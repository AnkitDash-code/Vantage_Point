You are tasked by the coaching staff to build a comprehensive \"Assistant Coach\" that can analyze performance data and provide actionable strategic insights.\nL66: Inspired by *Moneyball**'s* Peter Brand, you will build a near-real-time application that merges **micro-level player analytics**with **macro-level strategic review**. Your tool must analyze an individual player's Match data to provide a holistic and actionable review for coaches and players.\nL67: ##### Assistant Coach Requirements\nL68: Your AI assistant could perform the following core functions,**powered by official esports data from GRID (for League of Legends and VALORANT).**\nL69: * **Provide Personalized Player/Team Improvement Insights:**Analyze individual player data and/or team data to identify and present recurring mistakes, suboptimal patterns, or statistical outliers. The goal is to develop a tool that surfaces low-level insights, pinpoints areas for improvement, analyzes the data, and provides strategic insights for the team.\nL70: * **Generate an Automated Macro Game Review:** Use historical match data (e.g., from a recently concluded match) to automatically generate a review agenda. This agenda must highlight critical macro-level decision points, team-wide errors, or significant strategic moments.\nL71: * **How can you take it to the next level?**\nL72: + **Predict Hypothetical Outcomes:**Use historical data to model and predict the likely outcomes of alternative \"what if\" scenarios. This feature should allow a coach to query the tool about a past in-game decision or event in reference to the Macro Game Review (see above) and receive a predictive analysis. A key factor for success here will be the accuracy of this feature.\nL73: * You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable, leveraging your creative ideas and the available data.\nL74: ##### Demonstration Prompts & Required Outputs\nL75: Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must demonstrate your tool successfully processing data and generating insights. The following prompts are **examples only**, intended to illustrate the type and depth of analysis your tool should be capable of. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!","session_id":"6ebaabd5-124d-47ed-87d2-8b35ef2bbace","turn_count":3},"metadata":{"arguments":"{\"open\":[{\"lineno\": 1, \"ref_id\": \"https://cloud9.devpost.com/resources\"}, {\"lineno\": 1, \"ref_id\": \"https://cloud9.devpost.com/details/submissionspecifics\"}]}","display_result":"","duration":"8s","id":"call_1f1c299cedbb4c5c8ff8c883","is_error":false,"mcp_server":{"name":"mcp-server"},"name":"open","result":"[ref_id=turn1fetch0†cloud9.devpost.com†https://cloud9.devpost.com/resources]\n**viewing lines [1-89] of 110**\nL1: + 【1†Sign up】\nL2: Join a hackathon\nL3: 【2†DevpostParticipate in our public hackathons】\nL4: 【3†Hackathons】 【4†Projects】\nL5: 【5†Devpost for TeamsAccess your company's private hackathons】\nL6: 【6†Login】\nL7: Host a hackathon\nL8: 【7†DevpostGrow your developer ecosystem and promote your platform】\nL9: 【8†Host a public hackathon】\nL10: 【9†Devpost for TeamsDrive innovation, collaboration, and retention within your organization】\nL11: 【10†Host an internal hackathon】\nL12: By use case\nL13: 【11†AI hackathons】 【12†Customer hackathons】 【13†Employee hackathons】 【14†Public hackathons】\nL14: Resources\nL15: 【15†Blog Insights into hackathon planning and participation】\nL16: 【16†Customer stories Inspiration from peers and other industry leaders】\nL17: 【17†Planning guides Best practices for planning online and in-person hackathons】\nL18: 【18†Webinars & events Upcoming events and on-demand recordings】\nL19: 【19†Help desk Common questions and support documentation】\nL20: * Join a hackathon\nL21: + ##### Back\nL22: + 【20†DevpostParticipate in our public hackathons】\nL23: 【21†Hackathons】 【22†Projects】\nL24: 【23†Devpost for TeamsAccess your company's private hackathons】\nL25: 【24†Login】\nL26: * Host a hackathon\nL27: + ##### Back\nL28: + 【25†DevpostGrow your developer ecosystem and promote your platform】\nL29: 【26†Host a public hackathon】\nL30: 【27†Devpost for TeamsDrive innovation, collaboration, and retention within your organization】\nL31: 【28†Host an internal hackathon】\nL32: By use case\nL33: 【29†AI hackathons】 【30†Customer hackathons】 【31†Employee hackathons】 【32†Public hackathons】\nL34: * Resources\nL35: + ##### Back\nL36: + 【33†Blog Insights into hackathon planning and participation】\nL37: 【34†Customer stories Inspiration from peers and other industry leaders】\nL38: 【35†Planning guides Best practices for planning online and in-person hackathons】\nL39: 【36†Webinars & events Upcoming events and on-demand recordings】\nL40: 【37†Help desk Common questions and support documentation】\nL41: * 【38†Log in】\nL42: * 【39†Sign up】\nL43: ### 【40†Sky’s the Limit - Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon】\nL44: Deadline: Feb 3, 2026 @ 7:00pm 【41†UTC】\nL45: 【42†Join hackathon】\nL46: #\nL47: Descend\nL48: * 【43†Overview】\nL49: * 【44†My projects】\nL50: * 【45†Participants (1735)】\nL51: * 【46†Resources】\nL52: * 【47†Rules】\nL53: * 【48†Project gallery】\nL54: * 【49†Updates】\nL55: * 【50†Discussions】\nL56: * 【51†Submission Specifics】\nL57: #### Resources\nL58: Even the best players need a support team.

You will not receive additional points for successfully replicating these exact outputs. The tool will be judged on its overall functionality and value.\nL77: For all outputs, your system should provide the data or reasoning behind its insights.\nL78: ##### 1. Main Prompt: Personalized Insight Generation\nL79: * **Task:**\"Analyze this player's match data and provide direct, data-backed feedback.\"\nL80: * **Example Output (VALORANT):**\nL81: + **Data 1:** C9 loses nearly 4 out of 5 rounds (78%) when OXY dies 'for free' (without a KAST)\nL82: + **Sample Insight 1:**Player OXY's opening duel success rate heavily impacts the team, leading to a 78% round loss rate when dying first without a KAST. Recommend reviewing opening pathing and strategy.\nL83: + **Sample Insight 1:**Our strategy must ensure OXY is always in a position to get KAST. If he dies, it must be for a trade, kill, or assist, as 78% of rounds are lost otherwise.\nL84: + **Data 2:** C9 loses both pistol rounds 7/10 times they play 1-3-1 on Split.\nL85: + **Sample Insight 2:** Review starting composition or pistol round strategies on Split.\nL86: + **An example of Data + Insight:** C9 won the force buy in the 2nd round 7/10 times in the last 15 maps, but subsequently lost rounds 3 and 4, which started a snowball effect, having an overall negative impact on their game.\nL87: * **Example Output (League of Legends):**\nL88: * **Data:** When our jungler ganks top lane pre-6 minutes, their success rate is 22%. When ganking bot lane pre-6, the success rate is 68%.\nL89: * **Sample Insight:** This player's early topside pathing is frequently counter-jungled or results in low-impact ganks.

Recommend reviewing opening pathing and strategy.\nL83: + **Sample Insight 1:**Our strategy must ensure OXY is always in a position to get KAST. If he dies, it must be for a trade, kill, or assist, as 78% of rounds are lost otherwise.\nL84: + **Data 2:** C9 loses both pistol rounds 7/10 times they play 1-3-1 on Split.\nL85: + **Sample Insight 2:** Review starting composition or pistol round strategies on Split.\nL86: + **An example of Data + Insight:** C9 won the force buy in the 2nd round 7/10 times in the last 15 maps, but subsequently lost rounds 3 and 4, which started a snowball effect, having an overall negative impact on their game.\nL87: * **Example Output (League of Legends):**\nL88: * **Data:** When our jungler ganks top lane pre-6 minutes, their success rate is 22%. When ganking bot lane pre-6, the success rate is 68%.\nL89: * **Sample Insight:** This player's early topside pathing is frequently counter-jungled or results in low-impact ganks.

This could include recently played team compositions, preferred builds (for LoL), or common default defensive site setups (for VALORANT).\nL130: * **How can you take it to the next level?**\nL131: + Generate \"How to Win\" Insights: Instead of just listing an opponent's tendencies, your tool could suggest a direct, data-backed counter-strategy or identify an exploitable weakness. (e.g., \"Opponent X has a 15% win rate when their mid-laner is against an assassin. Recommend picking LeBlanc and Zed.\")\nL132: * You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable, leveraging your creative ideas and the available data.\nL133: ##### Demonstration Prompts & Required Outputs\nL134: Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must demonstrate your tool successfully generating a scouting report for a given opponent. The following outputs are **examples only,** intended to illustrate the type and depth of analysis your tool should be capable of. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!\nL135: * **Important:**Your submission is not bound by these specific examples. You will not receive additional points for successfully replicating these exact outputs. The tool will be judged on its overall functionality and value.\nL136: For all outputs, your system should provide the data or reasoning behind its insights.\nL137: ##### Main Prompt: Generate Scouting Report\nL138: * **Task:**\"Generate a full scouting report for [Opponent Team Name] based on their last [X] matches.\"\nL139: * **Example Output (VALORANT)****:** Generated Scouting Report for [Team X] in a **digestible reporting format**(The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)\nL140: + Common Strategies: On Attack, 70% of pistol rounds are a 5-man fast-hit on B-Site (Ascent). On Defense, they default to a 1-3-1 setup, rotating their Sentinel to mid.\nL141: + Player Tendencies: Player \"Jett\" has a 75% first-duel rate with an Operator on A-main defense.\nL142: + Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (68% on Split): Jett, Raze, Brimstone, Skye, Cypher.\nL143: + Let the creative juices flow!\nL144: * **Example Output (League of Legends):**Generated Scouting Report for [Team Y] in a **digestible reporting format**(The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)\nL145: + Common Strategies: Prioritizes first Drake (82% contest rate). Tends to 4-man group for first tower push, usually in bot lane at ~13 mins.\nL146: + Player Tendencies: Top laner has a 90% pick/ban rate on Renekton (either plays it or bans it). Mid laner has a KDA of 2.1 on control mages vs. 8.5 on assassins, indicating a clear weakness/preference.\nL147: + Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (60%): Ornn (Top), Viego (Jng), Azir (Mid), Zeri (Bot), Lulu (Sup). (This is a late-game, team-fight-oriented 'protect the carry' comp.)\nL148: + Actionable Insight: This team's win condition is their bot lane. Their jungler paths to bot 75% of the time pre-10 mins. Recommend aggressive counter-jungling on their top side and prioritizing early ganks on their mid-laner to shut down their secondary carry.\n\n[ref_id=turn10fetch0†Sky's the Limit - Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon - Devpost†https://cloud9.devpost.com/details/submissionspecifics]\n**viewing lines [150-188] of 227**\nL150: Back to top\nL151: #### Category 3: Drafting Assistant/Predictor (LoL)\nL152: ##### What to Build\nL153: You are a specialized Data Scientist & AI Strategist for Cloud9's League of Legends team. You are tasked with developing a real-time application that can simulate and predict draft picks/bans.\nL154: You will build an application that analyzes historical GRID Data (team compositions, player champion pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against opponents. The application serves as a valuable practice tool, enabling players and coaches to simulate various draft strategies as they prepare for matches and the actual competition. This tool is for League of Legends only.\nL155: ##### Drafting Assistant Requirements\nL156: Your application could perform the following core functions, **powered by official esports data from GRID (for League of Legends and VALORANT).**\nL157: * **Recommend Optimal Picks and Bans:** The tool could analyze an opponent player’s or team’s champion pools, recent match success, team synergies, counter-matchups, and champion-specific win rates to suggest the highest-impact picks and bans for the current match, against that specific opponent. The tool could evaluate the strength of the current friendly and enemy draft-in-progress.\nL158: * **How can you take it to the next level?**\nL159: + As the draft progresses, the tool will, turn by turn, provide recommendations/predictions for the next pick or ban based on how the draft has progressed so far (draft order is key) By analyzing their current draft, their players' history, and team-wide tendencies, the tool could present a probability distribution for their next few likely champion choices, allowing your team to ban or counter-pick proactively.\nL160: + Show Winrate Impact: The tool could display a real-time, predicted win-rate percentage based on the current draft state, illustrating how different picks/bans (predicted) might influence the odds.\nL161: * You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable, leveraging your creative ideas and the available data.\nL162: ##### Demonstration Prompts & Required Outputs\nL163: Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must demonstrate your tool successfully reacting turn-by-turn to a real or simulated League of Legends pick/ban phase. The following outputs are **examples only,** intended to illustrate the type and depth of analysis your tool should be capable of. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!\nL164: * **Important:** Your submission is not bound by these specific examples. You will **not** receive additional points for successfully replicating these exact outputs. The tool will be judged on its overall functionality and value.\nL165: For all outputs, your system should provide the data or reasoning behind its insights.\nL166: ##### Main Prompt: Live Draft Simulation\nL167: * **Task:**\"Show your tool reacting turn-by-turn to a real or simulated pick/ban phase against [Team X].\"\nL168: * **Example 1****:** Mid-Draft Recommendation & Winrate Impact (purely inspirational purposes, does not represent accurate data)\nL169: + Draft State:\nL170: - Blue (Enemy) Banned: Galio\nL171: - Blue (Enemy) Picked: Jinx (B1), Rell (B2), Viego (B3)\nL172: - Red (Us) Banned: Corki, Nautilus\nL173: - Red (Us) Picked: Ashe (R1), Braum (R2)\nL174: + Sample Outcome:\nL175: - Recommended R3 Pick\nL176: * 1. Sejuani -> 60% Predicted Winrate: Reason: High synergy (CC chain) with Ashe/Braum passives. Strong frontline vs. Viego. Provides AP damage.\nL177: * 2. Maokai -> 58% Predicted Winrate: Reason: Excellent gank setup for bot lane. Strong teamfight counter-engage vs. Rell/Viego.\nL178: * 3. Ryze -> 58% Predicted Winrate: Reason: Galio ban suggests possible Ryze pick. Steal Ryze here so they can’t pick it.\nL179: * 4. Jarvan IV -> 53% Predicted Winrate: Reason: High gank pressure to snowball bot lane. \"Cataclysm\" can lock down Jinx in fights.\nL180: - Warnings\nL181: * Bad draft situation due to top lane constraints: team needs AP damage. Consider Ziggs R1 bot lane in future drafts.\nL182: Back to top\nL183: #### Category 4: Event Mini-Game\nL184: ##### What to Build\nL185: You are a Game Developer tasked by Cloud9 and JetBrains to create a fun, engaging, and fast-paced mini-game for fans. Your game will be the main attraction at a booth during a major LCS or VCT event.\nL186: Your game needs to be easy to pick up, fun to play, and capture the excitement of esports! It must be something a fan can play in just a few minutes while waiting in line or visiting the booth. **The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.**\nL187: ##### Game Requirements\nL188: Your game could perform the following core functions or meet these design goals.","status":"completed"}},"type":"mcp"}</glm_block>

Category 1: A Comprehensive Assistant Coach: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes alongside historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.\nL96: 2. Category 2: Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report could highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VALORANT), or recently played comps (for VALORANT or League of Legends).\nL97: 3. Category 3: AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (League of Legends): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase.\nL98: 4. Category 4: Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT event booth or finals activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains event booth at Cloud9’s sole and absolute discretion.\nL99: * Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.\nL100: * Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements.\nL101: * New & Existing: Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant’s Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have significantly updated after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period.

> Now, let me answer the user's question.
</details>
Great, thanks for sharing all that context and the links – that helps a lot.

Let me go through your main questions one by one, using the official pages as the source of truth.

## 1) Do I need to do it for both games, or is just VALORANT fine?

**Short answer: You do NOT need to support both League of Legends and VALORANT. VALORANT-only is fully allowed for Category 1 and Category 2.**

Key evidence from the rules:

- Category 1 (Comprehensive Assistant Coach) and Category 2 (Automated Scouting Report Generator) are explicitly described as:
  - “powered by official esports data from GRID (for League of Legends and VALORANT)”【turn8fetch0】【turn10fetch0】
- That wording means you can use either game’s data – it doesn’t say “you must use both”.
- In the prizes table, the eligible submissions for these two categories are:
  - Category 1: “All Eligible Submissions submitted to the Comprehensive Assistant Coach powered by Data Science and AI (VAL or LoL)”【turn17fetch0】
  - Category 2: “All Eligible Submissions submitted to the Automated Scouting Report Generator (VAL or LoL)”【turn17fetch0】

“VAL or LoL” literally means “VALORANT or League of Legends” – so a VALORANT-only project is clearly within the rules.

Also, in Submission Specifics, they give separate example outputs for VALORANT and LoL for both categories【turn8fetch0】【turn10fetch0】. If supporting both were required, they wouldn’t give VALORANT-only examples as valid demos.

So:

- For Category 1 (Assistant Coach): you can build purely for VALORANT.
- For Category 2 (Scouting Report): you can build purely for VALORANT.
- Only Category 3 is restricted: it explicitly says “This tool is for League of Legends only.”【turn10fetch0】

You are totally safe focusing only on VALORANT for Category 1 or 2.

## 2) Which is harder even with an LLM backend: Category 1 or Category 2?

Given what you already wrote and the official descriptions, yes – Category 1 (Assistant Coach) is noticeably harder even if you use an LLM in the backend.

Here’s why, grounded in the official requirements:

- Category 1 wants:
  - Micro-level analytics (individual mistakes, player patterns)
  - Connected to macro-level strategy (how those mistakes impact overall outcomes)
  - Optional “what if” predictions with emphasis on accuracy【turn8fetch0】
- Category 2 wants:
  - Aggregate recent match data into a concise scouting report
  - Show:
    - common strategies
    - player tendencies
    - recent comps / default setups【turn10fetch0】
  - Optional “how to win” insights that are basically counter-strategies【turn10fetch0】

Why Category 1 is harder even with LLMs:

- Causal analysis is hard:
  - Category 1: “Identify and present recurring mistakes… and provide strategic insights for the team” and link micro errors to macro outcomes【turn8fetch0】.
  - LLMs are great at summarizing and finding patterns, but they are not inherently good at robust causal inference (proving that mistake X caused outcome Y, and quantifying it accurately).
  - For Category 1, to be impressive you almost certainly need:
    - proper statistical modeling, or
    - at least structured metrics that the LLM can reason over (e.g., you pre-compute win probabilities, impact scores, etc.), not just raw text.

- Category 2 is more about aggregation and summarization:
  - “Summarize Compositions & Setups… common default defensive site setups (for VALORANT)”【turn10fetch0】
  - That’s exactly where an LLM shines:
    - take structured stats (site setups, win rates, agent pools),
    - convert them into a clean human-readable report.
  - You don’t necessarily need complex causal modeling; just:
    - query/filter GRID data,
    - compute some basic stats,
    - use the LLM to explain and highlight.

- Even the “what if” part pushes Category 1 up in difficulty:
  - “Predict Hypothetical Outcomes… A key factor for success here will be the accuracy of this feature.”【turn8fetch0】
  - To do that well, you typically need:
    - some model behind the scenes (even if simple),
    - careful evaluation of probabilities,
    - and a way to demonstrate that your predictions are reasonable.
  - Category 2 doesn’t have that extra predictive expectation.

So your intuition here is correct:

- Category 1 = deeper data science + harder to get right, even with an LLM.
- Category 2 = simpler pipeline that matches LLM strengths (summarization + pattern highlighting).

If you want the highest chance of a polished, working demo by the deadline, Category 2 is the safer choice.

## 3) “Doesn’t strategy make Category 2 easier normally?”

Yes – that’s exactly the right intuition, and it’s consistent with the spec.

Think of it like this:

- Category 1 “strategy”:
  - Must explain WHY certain micro-moves cause macro outcomes (e.g., “When OXY dies without a KAST, we lose 78% of those rounds; therefore adjust his pathing”)【turn8fetch0】.
  - That requires:
    - good metric design,
    - correct correlations,
    - and careful explanations from the LLM so it doesn’t hallucinate false causes.

- Category 2 “strategy”:
  - Focuses on surfacing patterns:
    - “They attack B in 70% of pistol rounds on Ascent”
    - “Their default defense is 1-3-1, Sentinel rotates mid”
    - “Their Jett has a 75% first-duel rate with Operator on A-main”【turn10fetch0】
  - This is fundamentally easier for an LLM:
    - It just needs to describe patterns you compute from data.
    - You can constrain and validate those patterns programmatically.

So yes: from a strategy perspective, Category 2 is easier because:

- It is primarily about:
  - aggregation,
  - pattern spotting,
  - and summarization.
- Category 1 is about:
  - causality and impact modeling,
  - plus narrative (“Moneyball-style insights”),
  - plus optional “what if” predictions that are expected to be accurate.

You can absolutely add some nice “strategy” flavor in Category 2 (like recommending counters or exploiting weaknesses), but the baseline is closer to “automated analyst report” than “automated coach+analyst combined”.

## 4) Among the 4 categories, which will be the most commonly attempted?

Based on:

- The official descriptions of each category【turn8fetch0】【turn10fetch0】
- The prize structure【turn17fetch0】
- Typical hackathon behavior (people love building games, and fear heavy data/stats)

My prediction:

- Most attempted:
  - Category 4: Event Mini-Game (by far the most popular)
- Medium:
  - Category 2: Scouting Report Generator
  - Category 3: AI Drafting Assistant / Predictor (LoL)
- Least attempted:
  - Category 1: Comprehensive Assistant Coach

Why Category 4 will be the most common:

- Description: “create a fun, engaging, and fast-paced mini-game for fans… easy to pick up… a fan can play in just a few minutes… The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth”【turn10fetch0】.
- That hits:
  - game devs and fans (big overlap with hackathon participants),
  - people who enjoy creative/visual work over stats,
  - people who want something simple they can demo and is fun to show.
- Technically, it has the lowest “data friction”:
  - You don’t have to worry about GRID JSON schemas, complex stats, or deep ML.
  - You can mostly focus on Unity/Universe/web game tech, UX, and fun.

Why Category 1 will probably have the fewest entries:

- Requires:
  - comfort with data science/analytics,
  - decent ML/stats modeling (especially if you touch “what if” predictions),
  - integration with GRID esports data,
  - plus a coherent UX to show all that to coaches.
- Even with LLMs, doing it well is non-trivial.
- That matches your notes about “advanced analytics skills” being a barrier.

Why Category 2 and 3 are somewhere in the middle:

- Category 2:
  - Strong fit for LLMs and simpler analytics.
  - Still requires GRID integration and data work, so not everyone will go for it.
  - Attractive to people who like data but don’t want to go full “Moneyball ML coach”.
- Category 3:
  - LoL-only, so you’re limiting your audience to people specifically interested in LoL drafts【turn10fetch0】.
  - Domain-specific complexity around:
    - pick/ban logic,
    - champion synergies,
    - patch-dependent data.
  - Appeals to LoL players/data people, but that’s a smaller niche than “everyone who wants to build a fun mini-game”.

So strategically:

- If you want:
  - lower competition and you’re okay with harder data work → Category 1.
  - lower competition + easier to ship a strong demo with an LLM → Category 2.
- Expect a flood of Category 4 projects (mini-games), which makes standing out there harder despite the technical work being lighter.

## 5) Concrete recommendations for you

Based on everything you’ve written and the official pages:

- Game scope:
  - It is absolutely fine to do only VALORANT for Category 1 or 2【turn8fetch0】【turn10fetch0】【turn17fetch0】.
  - You don’t need to add LoL at all; focusing on one game usually gives you a cleaner, deeper demo.

- Category choice (1 vs 2):
  - If your main goal is:
    - higher odds of finishing something polished and strong,
    - making good use of LLMs without getting bogged down in complex modeling,
    → go with Category 2 (Scouting Report Generator).
  - If you:
    - really care about deep analytics and Moneyball-style narratives,
    - are comfortable adding some proper stats/modeling on top of the LLM,
    → Category 1 can be more impressive but is clearly harder.

- Practical next steps:
  - Apply for GRID data via the Resources tab (apply link points to the GRID hackathon form)【turn1fetch0】.
  - Decide:
    - one category,
    - one game (VALORANT),
    - and one clear use case (e.g., “Generate a full VALORANT scouting report for Sentinels based on their last 20 matches on Ascent/Haven/Lotus”).
  - Build:
    - a public GitHub repo with an OSI license,
    - a 3-minute demo video,
    - and fill out the Devpost submission including the category selection【turn15fetch0】.
  - In the demo, make sure:
    - you clearly show GRID data going in,
    - your app processing it,
    - and the final report or insights coming out (with enough reasoning visible that judges can see what’s happening).

If you tell me a bit more about your strengths (e.g., more comfy with ML, or more with UI/web, or with pure backend) and how much time you realistically have before Feb 3, I can help you choose definitively between Cat 1 and Cat 2 and sketch a concrete architecture for your VALORANT tool.

> Now, let me answer the user's question.
</details>
# Decision helper (short version):

- If your top priority is:  
  “I want the highest chance of having a polished, working, impressive demo by the deadline”  
  → pick Category 2 (Scouting Report Generator) with VALORANT.

- If your top priority is:  
  “I want to show off deeper analytics / ‘Moneyball’ style insights and I’m okay with harder data + modeling work”  
  → pick Category 1 (Assistant Coach) with VALORANT.

Below is the reasoning and some concrete project sketches for both so you can feel which one suits you.

---

## 1. What each category is really asking (VALORANT view)

From the official Devpost page:

- Category 1: Assistant Coach  
  You’re a “Data Scientist & AI Strategist”. You build a near-real-time app that:
  - analyzes individual player match data,
  - finds recurring mistakes / suboptimal patterns / outliers,
  - generates a macro game review agenda from a concluded match (key moments, team errors),
  - optionally models “what if” scenarios (predictive, with emphasis on accuracy).【turn3fetch0】

  VALORANT example they give:
  - “C9 loses nearly 4 out of 5 rounds (78%) when OXY dies ‘for free’ (without a KAST)”  
    → insight: his opening duel success massively impacts the team; fix pathing/strategy around him.【turn3fetch0】
  - Auto-generated review agenda: pistol round performance, eco issues, mid-round call failures, ultimate economy, etc.【turn3fetch0】

- Category 2: Scouting Report Generator  
  You’re a “Data Analyst”. You build an app that:
  - takes an opponent team as input,
  - scans their recent GRID match data,
  - outputs a concise scouting report: strategies, player tendencies, recent comps/setups,
  - optionally suggests “how to win” / counter-strategies.【turn3fetch0】

  VALORANT example they give:
  - “On Attack, 70% of pistol rounds are a 5-man fast-hit on B-Site (Ascent). On Defense, they default to a 1-3-1 setup, rotating Sentinel to mid.”
  - “Player ‘Jett’ has a 75% first-duel rate with an Operator on A-main defense.”
  - “Most-played comp (68% on Split): Jett, Raze, Brimstone, Skye, Cypher.”【turn3fetch0】

Both categories explicitly support “VAL or LoL” and give VALORANT-only examples, so you’re 100% fine doing only VALORANT in either category.【turn3fetch0】【turn3fetch0】

---

## 2. Difficulty comparison (honestly, what’s harder?)

Even with an LLM backend, Category 1 is harder.

Here’s a simple decision flow of the two paths:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Choose Category] --> B{Your main priority?}
  B -->|High chance of polished demo by deadline| C[Category 2 - Scouting Report]
  B -->|Deep analytics, Moneyball-style, okay with harder work| D[Category 1 - Assistant Coach]
  C --> E[Focus: clear opponent breakdown using recent GRID data, plus simple counters]
  D --> F[Focus: link micro mistakes to macro outcomes, optional what-if predictions]
```

Why Category 1 (Assistant Coach) is harder:

- Analytical depth:
  - You must connect micro-level player mistakes to macro-level outcomes (e.g., “when OXY dies for free, we lose 78% of rounds”)【turn3fetch0】.
  - That’s not just summarizing; it’s designing metrics and establishing patterns that actually mean something.
- Predictive / “what if” expectations:
  - The spec explicitly mentions modeling “what if” scenarios and emphasizes accuracy as a key success factor for that feature【turn3fetch0】.
  - Doing that in a convincing way usually needs more than just an LLM—it needs:
    - careful feature engineering,
    - some basic modeling (even simple),
    - or at least very well-designed stats and heuristics.
- Demo complexity:
  - You need to show the tool:
    - ingesting match data,
    - computing these links,
    - and explaining them in a way that looks “coach-level” smart.
  - It’s easier for judges to spot “fake” or weak insights here because the promises are bigger.

Why Category 2 (Scouting Report) is easier:

- Analytical scope:
  - It’s mostly about:
    - aggregation (last X matches for a given opponent),
    - pattern recognition (pistol round tendencies, defaults, site setups),
    - summarization into a compact report.【turn3fetch0】
  - This aligns perfectly with what LLMs are good at: explaining structured data clearly.
- Validation is simpler:
  - You can sanity-check everything against the data:
    - “70% of pistol rounds are B fast-hit on Ascent” is either true or false.
  - You don’t need strong causal claims; just “they tend to do X”.
- Demo is straightforward:
  - User: “Generate a scouting report for Team X on Ascent based on last 20 matches.”
  - Your system:
    - loads GRID JSON,
    - computes a handful of stats,
    - feeds them + prompts to the LLM,
    - and renders a nicely structured report.
  - That looks very concrete and easy for judges to understand in 3 minutes.

So if you’re thinking purely in terms of “which can I pull off well in limited time?” → Category 2 is the safer bet.

## 3. What each category would look like in practice (VALORANT-only)

Here are two concrete sketches. Imagine you pick one and build it.

A) Category 2 idea: “VALORANT Opponent Scouter”

- Input:
  - Opponent team name
  - Map pool (e.g., Ascent, Split, Lotus)
  - Number of recent matches to consider (e.g., last 20)

- Core features:
  1) Map-level tendencies
     - Pistol / bonus round strategies per map:
       - “70% of pistol rounds on Ascent attack are 5-man B hits.”
       - “On defense, they default 1-3-1, Sentinel rotates mid early.”
     - Site execution patterns:
       - Average first-contact timing for A vs B.
       - How often they do mid-to-B, etc.

  2) Player tendencies
     - Agent pool and usage (agents per player, pick rate, win rate).
     - Duel stats:
       - First duel success rate with Operator on specific positions (e.g., Jett A-main).
       - Consistency / KAST on key maps.

  3) Comps and setups
     - Most-played comps per map (agents + approximate roles).
     - Common default defenses (e.g., “3-site Ascent with Chamber + Killjoy anchor”).

  4) “How to exploit” (take it to the next level)
     - Simple, data-backed suggestions like:
       - “Their defense win rate on A is 33% when attacked with a Controller-heavy comp. Recommend Viper + Astra on A.”
       - “Their Jett has a low first-blood rate when the enemy sends an early recon dart (Sova/Fade). Consider early info.”

- Tech stack sketch:
  - Backend:
    - Python or Node/TypeScript in JetBrains IDE (PyCharm / IntelliJ IDEA).
    - Load GRID JSON files for selected matches.
    - Compute:
      - frequencies, win rates, simple time-based stats.
    - Use an LLM (via Junie / JetBrains AI tools / or any API) to:
      - turn these stats into bullet sentences,
      - generate a clean final report.
  - Frontend:
    - Minimal web UI with:
      - team/map/match-count selectors,
      - a generated report view (sections + charts if you have time).

- Why this is good for you:
  - Very clear demo story:
    - Show a real team name (e.g., Sentinels),
    - Pick Ascent / Split,
    - Hit “Generate” and walk through the report.
  - You don’t need complex modeling; just good queries, clean stats, and a nice LLM-written report.

B) Category 1 idea: “VALORANT Assistant Coach / Post-Game Reviewer”

- Input:
  - A specific match ID / match file from your own team.
  - Optional focus filters (map, player, phase).

- Core features:
  1) Player-level micro insights
     - Per-player:
       - Rounds where they die “for free” (no KAST).
       - Round win/loss rates after those deaths.
       - Crosshair placement / duel timing if the data supports it.
     - Example insight (like in spec):
       - “OXY’s opening duel success rate heavily impacts the team: 78% of rounds are lost when he dies first without a KAST.”【turn3fetch0】

  2) Macro review agenda
     - Auto-generated “review agenda” from a concluded match:
       - Pistol round outcomes and what went wrong.
       - Eco management (e.g., force-buy vs save, and subsequent rounds).
       - Mid-round call failures (late executes, etc.).
       - Ultimate economy usage (orbs picked up vs expected).【turn3fetch0】

  3) (If you have time) Simple “what if”
     - e.g., “What if we saved on round 2 instead of forcing?”
     - You can:
       - Implement simple heuristics (e.g., simulated credit patterns) and show projected round economy.
       - Ask the LLM to comment on impact: “Saving here would likely secure a stronger buy in round 4, increasing your win probability.”

- Tech stack sketch:
  - Backend:
    - Python (PyCharm) for heavy lifting:
      - pandas for manipulating match/frame data,
      - functions that tag events (dies for free, force buys, etc.).
    - LLM to:
      - describe patterns in natural language,
      - generate narrative comments on each agenda item.
  - Frontend:
    - Web UI that:
      - shows a timeline of the match,
      - lets coaches click on rounds or phases,
      - displays data + AI-written suggestions side-by-side.

- Why this is harder:
  - You need to invent meaningful metrics:
    - What counts as “dies for free”?
    - How do you detect a “failed mid-round call” from data alone?
  - The insights can easily feel vague or generic if you don’t ground them in solid stats.
  - Optional “what if” needs to look plausible, not like pure fantasy.

---

## 4. Which one should YOU pick?

A few guiding questions for you:

1) How comfortable are you with:
   - Pandas / basic stats and metric design?
   - Turning complex logs into clean event-level features?

   If:
   - Yes / excited → Category 1 is doable and can look very impressive.
   - No / sounds stressful → Category 2 is the better fit.

2) How much time do you have until Feb 3?

   - If you’re working solo or part-time:
     - Category 2 is much more forgiving.
     - You can ship a strong MVP with:
       - a few carefully chosen stats,
       - solid LLM prompts,
       - and a nice UI.
   - If you’re on a team with a strong data person and you want to aim high:
     - Category 1 can stand out more and fits the “Moneyball” narrative judges explicitly mention.

3) What kind of story do you want to tell in the 3-minute video?

   - Category 2 story:
     - “Before we face Team X, our coach opens this tool, clicks one button, and instantly gets a digestible, data-backed scouting report.”
   - Category 1 story:
     - “After our match, the coach opens the Assistant Coach, selects the match, and gets an AI-generated agenda: which players struggled in which situations, what macro decisions cost us the game, and a couple of ‘what if’ explorations.”

   Both are good stories; Category 2 is easier to show convincingly in 3 minutes because the outputs are more concrete and easier to verify.

My honest recommendation, given:

- you’re already set on VALORANT,
- you’re uncertain between 1 and 2,
- hackathon deadlines are always tight,

is:

- Choose Category 2 (Scouting Report Generator) as your main category.
- Scope it tightly:
  - One or two maps (e.g., Ascent + Split),
  - A small number of carefully designed stats,
  - A single, clean report layout.
- If you have extra time and appetite, take one feature from Category 1 (like a simple “micro error impact” stat) and integrate it into your scouting report as a “this opponent’s weak links” section.

That way, you get the best of both worlds: a more manageable path to a strong demo, with the option to sprinkle in Category 1-like depth if everything goes smoothly.

If you tell me:
- your stack preference (Python/TS/other),
- how many people are on your team,
- and roughly how many days you can realistically devote,

I can help you pick a final category and outline a very concrete build plan (week-by-week or day-by-day) tailored to you.

> 1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**
>     *   **Goal:** Decide between Category 1 (Assistant Coach) and Category 2 (Scouting Report Generator) for the "Sky's the Limit" hackathon.
>     *   **Context:**
>         *   Game: VALORANT (confirmed).
>         *   Category: Still undecided between 1 and 2.
>         *   Team Size: Solo (very important constraint).
>         *   Tech Stack:
>             *   Backend: Python.
>             *   Frontend: TypeScript + React + Vite / Next.js (flexible).
>         *   Constraints: Deadline is February 3, 2026. Need to build a public repo, 3-min video, demo.
> 
> 2.  **Re-evaluate Category Choice based on "Solo" + "Python + TS/React":**
>     *   **Solo Constraint:** Time management is critical. The user has to handle full-stack development (data fetching/processing, API integration, LLM logic, UI/UX) alone.
>     *   **Tech Stack:** Python for backend is great for data (pandas, numpy, fastapi/flask). React for frontend is standard and efficient for UI.

>         *   *Pros:* Python is perfect for the data science part.
>         *   *Cons:* The logic for connecting micro-errors to macro-outcomes is complex. As a solo dev, getting the *logic* right AND building the UI AND integrating the LLM is a huge risk. If the "insight" is weak, the project fails.
>     *   **Category 2 (Scouting Report Generator):**
>         *   *Pros:* Logic is simpler (aggregation). Python + Pandas can handle the stats easily. The UI (React) is just a report viewer. LLM just summarizes. This fits a solo dev's capacity much better.

>     *   *LLM Integration:* Use OpenAI API or similar (or Junie as per hackathon rules) via a simple Python wrapper.
>     *   *Frontend (React/Next.js):* Next.js might be overkill for a simple tool unless they want easy deployment/API routes. Vite is faster for local dev. I'll suggest Next.js for easy deployment on Vercel (standard hackathon move).

</details>
This stack (**Python + React/Next.js**) is absolutely perfect for a solo hackathon project. It gives you the best of both worlds: Python for the heavy data lifting, and React for a slick, "pro tool" interface that will look great on camera.

Given that you are **solo** and working with a **February 3 deadline**, the recommendation is decisive:

### **🏆 Go with Category 2: Scouting Report Generator**

Here is the logic based on your specific situation (Solo + Stack):

1.  **The "Solo Bottleneck" is Logic, not Code:**
    *   As a solo dev, you have a fixed amount of mental energy.
    *   **Category 1** would consume 80% of your energy trying to invent "Moneyball" metrics and validate causal links (e.g., *does this player dying *actually* cause the loss, or was the round already lost?*). This is math-heavy and risky.
    *   **Category 2** consumes only 30% of your energy on logic (it’s mostly counting and averaging). This frees up 70% of your energy to build a **stunning UI** in React and ensure your Python backend is rock solid.

2.  **Stack Advantage:**
    *   **Python (Pandas + FastAPI):** You can parse the GRID JSON, calculate win-rates/tendencies, and serve an API in minutes. This is exactly what Category 2 needs.
    *   **React/Next.js:** Scouting reports are visual. You need to show cards, progress bars, and clean typography. React is much faster for this than building a CLI tool or a heavy dashboard in Python (like Streamlit).
    *   **The "Hackathon Judge Factor":** Judges love clean UIs. If you submit a Category 2 project with a beautiful React interface that pulls live data, you will beat a Category 1 project that has "deeper math" but looks like a spreadsheet.

### 🛠 Recommended Architecture (Solo-Friendly)

Since you are doing this alone, you want to keep the backend dumb and the frontend pretty.

**1. Backend: Python (FastAPI)**
*   **Why?** It’s fast, auto-generates docs (Swagger UI), and handles async requests well.
*   **Tech:** `FastAPI`, `Pandas`, `Pydantic` (for data validation), `JetBrains PyCharm` (required for the hackathon).
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   `load_grid_data(match_ids)`: Loads JSONs into memory.
    *   `get_team_stats(team_name)`: Calculates win rates, agent usage, pick rates.
    *   `generate_report(team_name)`: Sends the stats to an LLM (OpenAI/Junie) and gets back a text summary.

**2. Frontend: TypeScript + Next.js (or Vite)**
*   **Why?** Next.js gives you easy routing (e.g., `/scout?team=Sentinels`) and API fetching hooks. Vite is faster if you don't need server-side rendering. I'd lean **Next.js** for the polished "App Router" feel.
*   **Tech:** `shadcn/ui` or `Chakra UI` (for pre-built components to save time), `Recharts` (for simple graphs), `JetBrains WebStorm` or `IntelliJ IDEA` (required).
*   **Key Views:**
    *   **Home:** Input field for Team Name.
    *   **Loading:** A cool "Analyzing GRID Data..." spinner.
    *   **Report:**
        *   *Header:* Team Logo + Name + Map.
        *   *Section 1 (Overview):* Win rate card (big number).
        *   *Section 2 (Agents):* Horizontal bar chart of agent usage.
        *   *Section 3 (LLM Summary):* The "Narrative" report generated by Python.
        *   *Section 4 (Exploits):* A "Red Alert" box showing their weakest map/comp.

---

### 🚀 The "Secret Sauce": How to win Category 2 as a Solo Dev

To make your Category 2 project stand out (and maybe even borrow some "Assistant Coach" flavor without the complexity), implement **one** advanced feature:

**Feature: The "Exploitability Score"**
Instead of just listing stats, write a Python function that calculates a simple "Risk Score" for the opponent.

*   **Logic:**
    ```python
    # Python pseudo-code
    def calculate_exploit_score(opponent_data):
        # If they play Agent X > 50% but Win Rate < 40% -> High Exploit
        # If they lose Map Y > 70% of time -> High Exploit
        score = (loss_rate_on_main_map + weakness_rate_on_fav_agent) / 2
        return score
    ```
*   **LLM Prompt:** Tell the LLM: *"Here is the data. The Exploitability Score is 85/100. Write a paragraph explaining exactly how to crush them based on this score."*
*   **React Display:** Show a circular progress bar for the "Exploit Score" in Red (High Risk) or Green (Safe).

This makes your tool feel like a **Category 1 (Assistant Coach)** tool but uses **Category 2 (Scouting)** logic. It’s easy to build but looks very smart.

### 📅 Solo Dev Timeline (To Feb 3)

**Phase 1: The Data Engine (Python) [Days 1-3]**
1.  Apply for GRID access (do this today).
2.  Set up PyCharm + FastAPI.
3.  Write a script that reads the sample GRID JSON (even if you don't have full access yet, mock the structure).
4.  Create endpoints: `/api/stats?team=XYZ` and `/api/report?team=XYZ`.

**Phase 2: The Interface (React) [Days 4-6]**
1.  Set up Next.js + shadcn/ui.
2.  Build the "Team Input" screen.
3.  Build the "Report" layout using dummy data.
4.  Connect the Frontend to the Python Backend.

**Phase 3: The Brains (LLM Integration) [Days 7-8]**
1.  Integrate the LLM (Junie or OpenAI) in Python.
2.  Craft a prompt that takes your Pandas stats and outputs a clean, bulleted "Coach's Report".
3.  Add the "Exploitability Score" logic mentioned above.

**Phase 4: Polish & Video [Days 9-10]**
1.  **JetBrains integration:** Make sure your demo video shows you coding in PyCharm or WebStorm (requirement for prizes).
2.  **The Video:** Record yourself saying "I'm about to play against Sentinels," clicking generate, and then using the report to explain *how* you will beat them.
3.  **Submission:** Push to GitHub, fill out Devpost.

### Summary
*   **Category:** 2 (Scouting Report).
*   **Game:** VALORANT only.
*   **Stack:** Python (FastAPI/Pandas) + Next.js (React/TS).
*   **Key Feature:** Actionable "Exploitability" insights using an LLM.

This plan maximizes your strengths (Full-stack coding) and minimizes the risk of getting stuck on complex math (Category 1). You can definitely ship this in time!

</details>
This is a **brilliant strategy**.

Building a solid Category 2 (Scouting) foundation first gives you a "safe harbor"—if you run out of time or struggle with the complex math of Category 1, you still have a polished, submittable project.

Here is exactly what you need to build **on top** of your Category 2 base to convert it into a winning Category 1 (Assistant Coach) project.

### The Foundation (Category 2 - What you already have)
*   **Input:** "Analyze Team X" (Broad).
*   **Data:** Aggregate stats (Win rates, Agent picks, Map win %).
*   **Logic:** Averages and Frequencies.
*   **UI:** A nice looking report card.

---

### The Upgrades (Category 1 - What you need to add)

To transform this into an Assistant Coach, you need to shift from "What do they do generally?" to "**What went wrong in THIS specific match?**"

Here are the 4 specific pillars you need to add:

#### 1. The "Micro-Error" Detector (New Metric Logic)
In Category 2, you calculate "Win Rate." In Category 1, you need to calculate **"Fault."**
You need Python functions that flag specific negative events in the match data.

*   **What to build:**
    *   **"Free Death" Detector:** A function that checks: `if player_death_time < 20s AND (kills == 0 AND assists == 0) AND team_lost_round == True`.
    *   **Economy Leak Detector:** A function that checks: `if round_lost AND team_money_after_round < 1000` (implies a bad buy).
    *   **Utility Failure:** `if player_is_controller AND smokes_planted == 0 AND team_lost_round`.

#### 2. The "Moneyball" Correlator (The "Why" Link)
This is the heart of Category 1. You need to mathematically prove that the Micro-Error caused the Macro-Loss.
You don't need a machine learning model; you need **Heuristic Scoring**.

*   **What to build:**
    *   Create a `RoundImpact` score in Python.
    *   *Formula:* `(Number of Free Deaths) * 2 + (Bad Economy) * 5`.
    *   *Correlation:* "In the 10 rounds where we had a high Impact Score (>5), we lost 9 of them."
    *   *The Insight:* The LLM takes this stat and says: *"Our eco-rounds are the primary cause of our loss. We are force-buying too early."*

#### 3. The "Review Agenda" Generator (Shift in Output)
Category 2 outputs a "Report." Category 1 must output a **"Meeting Agenda."**
Your LLM prompt needs to change from "Summarize" to "Prioritize."

*   **Prompt Shift (Cat 2 -> Cat 1):**
    *   *Old (Cat 2):* "Summarize the team's playstyle."
    *   *New (Cat 1):* "You are an Assistant Coach. You have the following error data: [List of errors]. Prioritize the top 3 issues that cost us the match. Structure it as a bullet-point list for the team meeting."

#### 4. The UI: From "Report" to "Timeline" (React Update)
This is the biggest frontend change.
*   **Category 2:** Shows a static page of charts.
*   **Category 1:** Needs an **Interactive Timeline**.

*   **What to build:**
    *   A horizontal timeline of the 24 rounds (e.g., `[W] [L] [W] [W] [L]...`).
    *   **Interaction:** When you hover/click a "Loss" round, it opens a modal showing:
        *   "Round 12 Loss."
        *   "Primary Error: OXY died for free (0:15)."
        *   "Secondary Error: No Spike Plant."

---

### The "What If" Simulator (The Bonus Feature)
This is the "Cherry on top" that explicitly secures the Category 1 requirements ("Predict Hypothetical Outcomes").

*   **Implementation (Python):**
    *   Don't build a full game engine.
    *   Build a **"Credit Simulator."**
    *   Take the match data. Find the rounds you lost.
    *   Scenario: "What if we saved round 4 instead of buying?"
    *   Logic: `round_4_money_saved + round_5_base_money`.
    *   Output: "In Round 5, you would have had had $5400 instead of $2100 (Full Buy)."
    *   React Display: A simple "Before/After" toggle showing the projected economy graph.

---

### 🛠 Execution Plan: How to Convert

Since you are solo, use this workflow to build Cat 2 first, then morph it into Cat 1.

**Phase 1: Build Cat 2 (The "Safe" Base)**
*   Backend: `get_team_stats(team_name)` (Averages).
*   Frontend: Static Report View.
*   *Status:* **This is your fallback submission.**

**Phase 2: Add the "Micro-Error" Logger (Cat 1 Prep)**
*   Write the Python functions `find_free_deaths(match_data)` and `calculate_economy_leaks(match_data)`.
*   Run these functions on *your own* match data (mock it if you have to).
*   Store the results in a list of "Mistakes".

**Phase 3: The UI Pivot (The Timeline)**
*   In React, keep the Report View, but add a new tab called **"Match Review"**.
*   Build the Round Timeline there.
*   Feed your "Mistakes" list into this timeline.

**Phase 4: The "Moneyball" Synthesis (The LLM)**
*   Feed the "Mistakes" list to the LLM.
*   Ask for the "Agenda".
*   Display that Agenda prominently on the Match Review tab.

### Why this is the winning move:
If you finish Phase 4, you have a killer Category 1 project.
If you get stuck on Phase 3 or 4 (e.g., the timeline is too hard, or the logic is buggy), you **delete those tabs**, polish the **Phase 1 Report View**, and submit as Category 2.

You lose nothing and gain the option to aim for the top prize.

## 5. Core Logic & Algorithms (Python)

This is where the "Moneyball" magic happens.

### 5.1 Shared Data Structure
All JSON data from GRID is converted into a Pandas DataFrame `df_match`.
*   *Columns:* `round_id`, `player_id`, `kill_time`, `damage_done`, `weapon`, `team_money`, `round_result` (Win/Loss).

### 5.2 Category 2 Logic: Aggregation (Scouting)
*   **Agent Usage:**
    ```python
    agent_counts = df_match['agent_name'].value_counts(normalize=True)
    ```
*   **Map Win Rate:**
    ```python
    map_wins = df_match[df_match['map'] == 'Ascent']['round_result'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Win' else 0).mean()
    ```

### 5.3 Category 1 Logic: The "Impact Score" (Assistant Coach)
This is the heuristic correlation engine.

*   **Step A: Detect Micro-Errors (Free Death)**
    ```python
    def is_free_death(row):
        # Logic: Died < 20s, No Assist, No Kill, Team Lost Round
        return (row['time_of_death'] < 20) and \
               (row['assists'] == 0) and \
               (row['kills'] == 0) and \
               (row['team_result'] == 'Loss')
    ```
*   **Step B: Calculate Impact Score**
    We assign a weight to errors to see how much they hurt the team.
    ```python
    IMPACT_WEIGHTS = {
        "free_death": 5.0,
        "bad_buy": 8.0,      # Buying when economy is bad
        "no_utility": 3.0     # Controller not smoking
    }
    
    df_match['impact_score'] = df_match.apply(lambda x: calculate_score(x), axis=1)
    ```
*   **Step C: Correlate Impact to Loss**
    ```python
    # Do high impact scores correlate with losses?
    correlation = df_match.groupby('round_id')['impact_score'].sum().corr(df_match['round_result_bin'])
    # Result: "When Impact Score > 10, we lose 80% of rounds."
    ```

### 5.4 Category 1 Logic: The "What-If" Simulator
Simple arithmetic economy simulation.
```python
def simulate_economy(current_round_money, decision):
    if decision == "SAVE":
        return current_round_money + 1500 + 2000 # Save + Next Round Base
    else:
        return current_round_money - 5000 # Spent it all
```

---

## 6. Frontend UI Specifications (React/Next.js)

### 6.1 Components
1.  **`TeamSearchBar.tsx`:** Input field for Team Name.
2.  **`StatCard.tsx`:** Displays a single metric (e.g., "Win Rate: 65%").
3.  **`AgentChart.tsx`:** Bar chart showing agent usage (Recharts).
4.  **`NarrativeBlock.tsx`:** Renders the LLM text summary.
5.  **`RoundTimeline.tsx`** (Cat 1 only): Horizontal scrollable list of rounds [1][2][3]... Clicking one opens the error modal.

### 6.2 LLM Prompting Strategy
**Prompt for Scouting (Cat 2):**
> "You are a VALORANT analyst. Here is data on Team X: {JSON stats}. Write a 3-sentence summary of their playstyle for a coach. Highlight their strongest map and most frequent agent composition."

**Prompt for Assistant Coach (Cat 1):**
> "You are a strict coach. Our team lost. Here is a list of errors: {List of errors}. Identify the #1 recurring mistake that cost us the match. Be direct and actionable."

---

### 📋 **Phase 1: Backend Setup & Data Modeling**
**Goal:** Initialize FastAPI, define Pydantic models for VALORANT data, and set up the folder structure.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Python Backend Engineer. I am building a VALORANT Esports Scouting Tool using FastAPI and Pandas.

Context:
- Game: VALORANT (Tactical Shooter).
- Roles: Duelist (Jett, Phoenix), Initiator (Sova, Fade), Controller (Omen, Viper), Sentinel (Killjoy, Cypher).
- Stats involved: Kills, Deaths, Assists, ACS (Average Combat Score), KAST% (Kill, Assist, Survive, Trade), First Bloods.

Task 1: Project Structure
Create the file structure for a Python backend project:
- `app/` (main module)
- `app/models/` (Pydantic models)
- `app/api/` (Routers)
- `app/core/` (Config)

Task 2: Requirements
Generate a `requirements.txt` including:
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn[standard]`
- `pandas`
- `pydantic`
- `numpy`
- `python-dotenv`

Task 3: Pydantic Models
Create `app/models/valorant.py` with Pydantic models for:
1. `PlayerMatchStats`: (player_name, agent, kills, deaths, assists, first_bloods, acs, kast)
2. `MatchRound`: (round_number, winning_team, team_money_start, team_money_end)
3. `TeamScoutInput`: (team_name, map_name: Optional[str] = None, last_n_matches: int = 20)

Ensure all fields are strictly typed with Python type hints.

Docs Reference:
- Pydantic: https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/

### 📊 **Phase 2: Core Scouting Logic (Pandas)**
**Goal:** Implement the data analysis functions that calculate win rates, agent pools, and map tendencies.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Data Scientist specializing in Sports Analytics. I need Python functions using Pandas to analyze VALORANT match data.

Context:
- We have a DataFrame `df_matches` containing historical match data.
- Columns in `df_matches`:
  - 'map_name' (e.g., 'Ascent', 'Lotus', 'Split')
  - 'team_name' (e.g., 'Sentinels', 'Cloud9')
  - 'result' (Win/Loss)
  - 'player_agent' (e.g., 'Jett', 'Sova')
  - 'round_won' (Boolean)
  - 'first_blood' (Boolean, did this team get the first kill)

Task: Write the following functions in `app/core/analyzer.py`:

1. `calculate_win_rate(df: pd.DataFrame, team_name: str, map_filter: str = None) -> float`:
   - Filter by team_name.
   - If map_filter is provided, filter by map_name.
   - Calculate win percentage (Wins / Total Matches).
   - Handle edge case: If no matches found, return 0.0.

2. `get_agent_composition(df: pd.DataFrame, team_name: str) -> List[Dict]`:
   - Filter by team_name.
   - Count occurrences of each 'player_agent'.
   - Calculate the 'pick_rate' (Count / Total Rounds).
   - Return a list of dicts: [{'agent': 'Jett', 'pick_rate': 0.4, 'total_rounds': 100}].

3. `get_map_tendencies(df: pd.DataFrame, team_name: str) -> Dict`:
   - Filter by team_name.
   - Group by 'map_name' and calculate win rate per map.
   - Identify the 'best_map' (highest win rate with > 2 matches played).
   - Identify the 'worst_map' (lowest win rate).

4. `get_first_blood_rate(df: pd.DataFrame, team_name: str) -> float`:
   - Filter by team_name.
   - Calculate how often the team secures the first kill in a round.

Constraints:
- Use vectorized Pandas operations (no for-loops over rows).
- Add Docstrings explaining the logic.
- Ensure type hinting for all inputs and outputs.

Docs Reference:
- Pandas GroupBy: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/groupby.html
- Pandas Filtering: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/03_subset_data.html
```

---

### 🌐 **Phase 3: FastAPI Implementation**
**Goal:** Wrap the logic in a REST API endpoint.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Backend Engineer. I need to create a FastAPI router for the Scouting functionality.

Context:
- File: `app/api/scout.py`
- Logic file: `app.core.analyzer`
- Models: `app.models.valorant`

Task: Create a POST endpoint `/scout/generate`.

Input Payload (Pydantic Model):
- team_name: str
- map_name: Optional[str] (e.g., "Ascent")
- last_n_matches: int (default 20)

Logic Flow:
1. Receive JSON payload.
2. Load mock data (for now, create a helper function `load_mock_data()` that returns a Pandas DataFrame with dummy VALORANT data covering maps like Ascent, Bind, and agents like Jett, Sova, etc.).
3. Call the analyzer functions from `app.core.analyzer`:
   - `calculate_win_rate`
   - `get_agent_composition`
   - `get_map_tendencies`
   - `get_first_blood_rate`
4. Construct a JSON response with the calculated stats.
5. Return a JSONResponse with status code 200.

Response Structure:
{
  "team_name": "...",
  "map_filter": "...",
  "overview": { "win_rate": 0.6, "matches_analyzed": 20 },
  "agents": [ ... ], // list of agent dicts
  "maps": { "best_map": "...", "win_rate_best": 0.8 },
  "tendencies": { "first_blood_rate": 0.55 }
}

Constraints:
- Use `APIRouter` from fastapi.
- Add error handling (try/except) to return 500 if analysis fails.
- Include a Docstring for the endpoint.

Docs Reference:
- FastAPI Request Body: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/
- FastAPI Routers: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/
```

---

### ⚛️ **Phase 4: Frontend Setup (Next.js + TypeScript)**
**Goal:** Initialize the React app and install necessary UI libraries.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior React Developer. Initialize a Next.js 14 project using the App Router.

Task 1: Initialization
- Run `npx create-next-app@latest scout-tool --typescript --tailwind --eslint`
- Enable App Router.

Task 2: Install Libraries
Install the following dependencies via npm/yarn:
- `lucide-react` (for icons)
- `recharts` (for charts)
- `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` (for class merging)
- `axios` (for API calls)

Task 3: Component Utility
Create `lib/utils.ts` with a function `cn(...)` to merge Tailwind classes using clsx and tailwind-merge.

Task 4: Folder Structure
Set up the `components/` folder:
- `components/ui/` (for generic UI elements)
- `components/scout/` (for specific scouting logic components)

Docs Reference:
- Next.js App Router: https://nextjs.org/docs/app
- Recharts: https://recharts.org/en-US/
- Shadcn UI setup: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation
```

---

### 🖼️ **Phase 5: Frontend UI & API Integration**
**Goal:** Build the main scouting page, the API hook, and the charts.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. I need to build the main Scouting Report page.

Context:
- API URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scout/generate`
- Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Recharts.

Task 1: Types
Create `types/scout.ts` defining the TypeScript interfaces for the API Response JSON structure defined in the previous phase.

Task 2: API Hook
Create a hook `hooks/useScoutData.ts` using `axios`.
- Function `generateScoutReport(teamName, map, matches)`
- Return `{ data, loading, error, refetch }`.

Task 3: Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)
Build a UI with:
1. A clean Header: "VANTAGE POINT | VALORANT SCOUT".
2. A Form:
   - Input: Team Name (Text)
   - Input: Map (Select/Text - Optional)
   - Button: "Analyze Team" (Triggers the API Hook).
3. A "Loading" state (Spinner/Skeleton).
4. A "Results" section (hidden until data loads).

Task 4: The Results View
In the Results section, create a grid layout displaying:
- **Overview Card:** Big bold Win Rate %.
- **Map Analysis:** Best/Worst map text.
- **Agent Composition Chart:** Use `Recharts` (BarChart) to visualize Agent Pick Rates (x-axis: Agent, y-axis: Pick Rate).
- **First Blood Rate:** A simple progress bar or percentage badge.

Styling:
- Use dark mode colors (Slate-900 background, Slate-800 cards).
- Use Emerald-500 for wins, Rose-500 for losses.
- Ensure it looks like a professional Esports dashboard.

Docs Reference:
- Recharts BarChart: https://recharts.org/en-US/api/BarChart
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect): https://react.dev/reference/react
```

### 📚 **VALORANT Knowledge Base (For Context)**
*Paste this into your AI's "Knowledge" or "Context" section if it allows long-term memory, or include it at the top of prompts.*

```text
VALORANT DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
- Agents are divided into 4 classes: Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, Sentinels.
- Maps have specific sites (A site, B site, C site). Maps include: Ascent, Bind, Haven, Split, Icebox, Breeze, Fracture, Pearl, Lotus, Sunset, Abyss.
- "Economy" is crucial: Teams buy rifles (Vandal, Phantom) on "Full Buys" and save on "Eco rounds".
- "First Blood" is the first kill of the round; it provides a significant advantage.
- "ACS" is Average Combat Score; a standard measure of player performance (250 ACS is average, 300+ is good).
- "KAST" is the percentage of rounds where a player had a Kill, Assist, Survived, or was Traded.
- GRID Data format usually provides frame-by-frame or round-by-round data including player positions, economy, and damage events.
```

### USER
the llm using groq is missing

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true">
> 1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**

>     *   **Context:** The user is building the "Category 2" part of the project (Scouting Report).
>     *   **Requirement:** I need to write prompts to integrate Groq (using the Groq API) into the existing architecture to generate the *narrative summary* of the scouting report.
> 
> 2.  **Determine the Scope of the "Groq Phase":**

> 3.  **Drafting the Prompt - Step-by-Step:**
> 
>     *   **Context:** Remind the AI (Codex/Cursor) that we are adding an LLM layer to the existing FastAPI backend. The provider is Groq.

</details>
Here are the specific prompts to integrate **Groq** (using the Llama 3 model) into your backend for generating the scouting narrative.

Since you are using FastAPI and Python, I have broken this down into setting up the Groq client and then integrating it into your existing endpoint.

---

### 🤖 **Phase 6: Groq LLM Setup & Logic**
**Goal:** Set up the Groq Python SDK and create the logic to turn Pandas stats into a human-readable narrative.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Python Backend Engineer specializing in LLM integration. We are adding Groq to our FastAPI project to generate text summaries for VALORANT data.

Context:
- We are using Groq for fast inference.
- Model: `llama3-70b-8192` (High speed and intelligence).
- Input: A dictionary containing calculated stats (win_rate, agents, maps, first_blood_rate).
- Output: A string summary.

Task 1: Dependencies & Config
1. Add `groq` to the `requirements.txt`.
2. Create `app/core/groq_client.py`.
3. In `groq_client.py`:
   - Import `Groq` from `groq`.
   - Initialize the client using an environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY`.
   - Handle the case where the key might be missing.

Task 2: The Generation Function
Create a function `generate_scout_summary(team_name: str, stats: dict) -> str` in `app/core/groq_client.py`.

Prompt Engineering Instructions (Internal):
- Construct a `system_message`:
  "You are an expert VALORANT esports analyst and coach. You provide concise, tactical insights based on data."
- Construct a `user_message` passing the stats dictionary.
- Ask the LLM to return a 3-paragraph summary:
  1. Overall Team Performance (Win Rate).
  2. Map Strategy & Weakness (Best/Worst maps).
  3. Agent Pool Tendencies (Key players/agents).
- Constraints: Keep the tone professional. Use bullet points for readability. Do not hallucinate data.

Code Implementation:
- Use `chat.completions.create`.
- Use model `llama3-70b-8192`.
- Set `temperature=0.3` (for more deterministic/factual output).
- Return the `message.content` string.

Docs Reference:
- Groq Python SDK: https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart
- Groq Models: https://console.groq.com/docs/models
```

---

### 🔗 **Phase 7: Integration with FastAPI Endpoint**
**Goal:** Update the existing `/scout/generate` endpoint (from Phase 3) to call the Groq function and include the text in the API response.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Backend Engineer. We need to update the existing FastAPI router to include the LLM summary generated by Groq.

Context:
- File to modify: `app/api/scout.py`.
- Function exists: `generate_scout_summary(team_name, stats)` in `app.core.groq_client`.
- Existing endpoint: `POST /scout/generate` (currently returns stats without narrative).

Task:
1. Import `generate_scout_summary` from `app.core.groq_client`.
2. Inside the endpoint logic, after you have calculated all the stats (win_rate, agents, etc.) into a dictionary variable (let's call it `report_data`):
   - Call `generate_scout_summary(team_name=team_name, stats=report_data)`.
   - Store the result in a variable `summary_text`.
3. Add this `summary_text` to the final JSON response dictionary under the key `"narrative_summary"`.

Updated Response Structure:
{
  "team_name": "...",
  "overview": { ... },
  "agents": [ ... ],
  "maps": { ... },
  "tendencies": { ... },
  "narrative_summary": "AI GENERATED TEXT HERE..."
}

Error Handling:
- If the Groq API fails (e.g., timeout, auth error), catch the exception.
- If it fails, set `"narrative_summary"` to a placeholder string: "Summary generation failed. Please check API keys." so the frontend doesn't break.

Constraints:
- Ensure the API call to Groq does not block the entire app if it takes time (though Groq is fast, simple `try/except` is sufficient for now).
- Keep the code clean and commented.
```

---

### 💻 **Frontend Phase 8: Displaying the Narrative**
**Goal:** Update the React frontend to render the Markdown/text returned by Groq.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Frontend Developer. We need to update the Scouting Report page to display the AI-generated narrative.

Context:
- File: `app/page.tsx` (or `components/scout/ReportView.tsx`).
- API Response now contains a new field: `narrative_summary` (String).
- We are using Tailwind CSS.

Task:
1. In the Results View section, add a new card below the charts.
2. Card Title: "AI Coach Insights" or "Scouting Summary".
3. Card Content:
   - Display the `narrative_summary` text.
   - Style it with `prose` (typography plugin) or standard Tailwind text classes (`text-slate-300 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap`).
   - Add a visual indicator that this is AI-generated (e.g., a small sparkline icon and "Powered by Groq + Llama3" text).

Styling:
- Background: `bg-slate-800`.
- Border: `border-slate-700`.
- Text: `text-slate-200`.
- Make the card stand out slightly to draw attention to the insights.

Bonus:
- If you are familiar with `react-markdown`, you can install it and use `<ReactMarkdown>{narrative_summary}</ReactMarkdown>` to render any bullet points or bold text the AI creates nicely.
```

---

### 🔑 **Environment Variables Setup**

**Prompt (for your terminal or manual setup):**
```text
Act as a DevOps engineer. I need to set up the environment variables for this Python project.

Task:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the Python project.
2. Add the following line:
   `GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`
3. Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` so I don't commit my secrets.

Note: Remind the user that they need to get their API key from https://console.groq.com/keys.
```

### USER
https://grid.helpjuice.com/en_US/cloud9-x-jetbrains-hackathon and https://docs.grid.gg/public/documentation/api-documentation/game-developers/quick-start-guide are the links for the actual grid api docs not what you mentioned also rewrite the whole prompts with ai integrated into it from start as a rag will be needed to provide the correct input into the llm so it generates valorant relevant output for that langchain + pgvector/faiss + sentence_transformers mini_llm for the embedding and semantic chunking from langchain done and cached take care of all other nuances that might occur also include valorant related guides etc so the ai can generate a proper knowledge base valorant is complex it consists of economy , strategy , game sense , aim , movement , maps, agents  and many other factors these have to be integrated into this phase for proper outputs from the scouting report and also the llm outputs being proper for category 2 and also category 1 for now focusing on category 2

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true">

Since I can't physically download files, I will instruct the AI to create a *loader* that reads from a local `data/knowledge_base` folder (which the user will fill) or include a robust embedded set of "strings" in the code for the hackathon demo. *Decision:* Prompt for a robust `load_knowledge_base` function that processes markdown/text files.
>     *   *Phase 3 (GRID API):* The user gave specific links. I need to tell the AI to read these docs (conceptually) or write code that implements the `quick-start` pattern (API Key -> Match List -> Match Details).
>     *   *Phase 4 (Pandas):* Standard analysis, but specific to GRID data structure (JSON nesting).
>     *   *Phase 5 (The Brain):* This is the hardest part.
>         *   Input: Pandas Stats.
>         *   Retrieval: "We are analyzing Ascent. Search for 'Ascent default defense strategies' or 'Ascent retake tips'."
>         *   Prompting: "You are a coach. Here is the opponent data: [Data]. Here is relevant game sense info: [Retrieved Context]. Write the report."
> 
> 5.  **Addressing "Nuances" & "Edge Cases":**
> 
>     *   *Caching:* Vector stores are files. Load them once on startup.
>     *   *Missing Data:* GRID might not have all maps. Handle None/NaNs.
>     *   *Concurrency:* FastAPI with background tasks if needed (probably not for this scale).
> 
> 6.  **Writing the Specific Prompts (Mental Sandbox):**
> 
>     *   *Prompt 1:* Needs `faiss-cpu`, `langchain`, `sentence-transformers`, `groq`, `pandas`.
>     *   *Prompt 2 (RAG):* "Create a `KnowledgeBase` class. It takes a list of text documents. It chunks them into 500-char pieces with 50-char overlap. It creates embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`. It saves `index.faiss` locally."
>     *   *Prompt 3 (GRID):* "Create a `GridClient` wrapper. It needs an API Key. It has a method `get_match_data(match_id)` that parses the complex JSON from GRID into a Pandas DataFrame." (I will need to provide a sample JSON structure or tell the AI to use the provided docs to infer the structure. *Correction*: The AI can't browse the live docs during generation usually. I will ask it to create a *flexible* parser or assume the standard format provided in the Quick Start Guide).
>     *   *Prompt 4 (The Logic):* "Combine them. When generating the report: 1. Get stats. 2. Query FAISS for 'map strategy tips'. 3. Send stats + tips to Groq."
> 
> 7.  **Reviewing against User Constraints:**
> 
>     *   *GRID Docs:* Explicitly mentioned in the prompt instructions.
>     *   *LangChain + pgvector/faiss:* Explicitly included.
>     *   *Mini LLM (Embeddings):* Explicitly specified (`sentence_transformers`).
>     *   *Valorant Complexity:* Explicitly requested in the context.
>     *   *Category 2 focus:* Kept the output structure as a Scouting Report.
> 
> 8.  **Final Polish of Prompts:** Ensure the tone is authoritative and the code blocks are clean. (Self-Correction: Make sure to tell the user *what* files they need to create for the knowledge base, otherwise the RAG is empty).
> 
> **(Self-Correction during drafting Phase 3):** The GRID API requires a specific token flow (Bearer token). The prompt must instruct the AI to handle authentication headers correctly.
> 
> **(Self-Correction during drafting Phase 5):** RAG retrieval needs to be dynamic. If the opponent plays Jett, we shouldn't retrieve Omen tips. The prompt must instruct the LLM to use the *specific stats* (like "High Duelist pick rate") to drive the retrieval query.

> Let's generate the response.
</details>
This is a significant architectural upgrade. By introducing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, your tool will no longer just summarize numbers; it will "know" *why* a strategy is bad based on game theory, map layouts, and agent capabilities.

Here are the comprehensive, step-by-step prompts to build **Category 2 (Scouting)** with the **GRID API**, **Groq (Llama 3)**, **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and a **Valorant Knowledge Base**.

---

### 🧠 **Phase 1: Environment Setup & RAG Infrastructure**
**Goal:** Set up the Python environment with all necessary libraries for Vector DB, LLMs, and Data handling.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Python ML Engineer. I am building a VALORANT Scouting Tool using RAG.

Context:
- Backend: FastAPI
- LLM: Groq (Llama 3)
- Vector Store: FAISS (Local file-based, no Postgres needed for speed)
- Embeddings: SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Framework: LangChain
- Data Source: GRID Esports API
- Knowledge Base: Local text files containing VALORANT game guides.

Task 1: Project Structure & Dependencies
1. Create `requirements.txt` with these specific versions (or latest):

  - `knowledge/` (Directory to store .txt/.md files for Valorant guides)
  - `data/` (Where FAISS index will be saved)

Task 3: Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file template requiring:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `GRID_API_KEY`
- `GRID_API_URL` (Base URL)

Docs Reference:
- LangChain FAISS: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss/
- Groq LangChain: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/groq/
- Sentence Transformers: https://www.sbert.net/
```

---

### 📚 **Phase 2: Building the VALORANT Knowledge Base (RAG)**
**Goal:** Create the logic to ingest VALORANT game guides (Strategy, Economy, Maps, Agents) into a Vector Store.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an NLP Engineer. Implement the RAG ingestion pipeline for our Valorant Knowledge Base.

Context:
- File: `app/core/knowledge_base.py`
- We will have text files in `app/knowledge/` (e.g., `ascent_strategy.md`, `economy_guide.txt`, `jett_guide.md`).
- These files contain complex game theory: "When to save on round 12", "Ascent A-site retake setups", "Jett operator positions".
- Use `CharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain to chunk text.

Task 1: The Loader
Create a function `load_valorant_guides(directory: str) -> List[Document]`.
- It should read all `.txt` and `.md` files in the directory.
- Use `DirectoryLoader` from `langchain_community.document_loaders`.

Task 2: Splitting & Embedding
Create a class `ValorantRAG`:
- `__init__`:
  - Initialize embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`.
  - Load existing FAISS index from `data/faiss_index` if it exists.
- `create_index`:
  - Use `CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)`.
  - Split the documents.
  - Create a `FAISS` vectorstore from the documents and embeddings.
  - Save the index locally to `data/faiss_index`.
- `get_relevant_context`:
  - Input: `query` (string) and `k` (number of results).
  - Perform a similarity search against the loaded index.
  - Return the top `k` document page contents.

Constraints:
- Ensure the context retrieved is relevant to *specific* keywords (e.g., "Ascent", "Eco", "Retake").
- Handle the case where no files exist (empty index).

Docs Reference:
- LangChain Text Splitters: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/
- FAISS Load/Save: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss/
```

---

### 🏟️ **Phase 3: GRID API Integration (Real Data)**
**Goal:** Implement the client to fetch data from the official GRID API using the docs provided.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an API Integration Specialist. Implement the client for the GRID Esports API.

Context:
- Docs: https://grid.helpjuice.com/en_US/cloud9-x-jetbrains-hackathon and https://docs.grid.gg/public/documentation/api-documentation/game-developers/quick-start-guide
- File: `app/grid/client.py`
- We need to fetch match data specifically for VALORANT.

Task 1: Authentication
- Create a `GridClient` class.
- `__init__`: Takes `api_key`.
- Headers: Must include `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.

Task 2: Fetching Match List
Create a method `get_recent_matches(team_name: str, game: str = "VALORANT", limit: int = 20) -> List[Dict]`:
- Endpoint logic: Based on docs, usually involves filtering by team/game.
- Return a list of match metadata (IDs, dates).

Task 3: Fetching Match Details
Create a method `get_match_details(match_id: str) -> Dict`:
- Fetch the full match JSON (including rounds, player stats, economy).
- Note: The JSON structure is nested. You don't need to flatten it fully yet, just return the raw JSON dict.

Task 4: Pandas Conversion
Create a helper function `convert_to_dataframe(match_data: Dict) -> pd.DataFrame`:
- Flatten the JSON into a tabular format for easier analysis.
- Columns needed: `round_number`, `winning_team`, `player_name`, `agent`, `kills`, `deaths`, `acs`, `economy_start`.
- Normalize the nested lists (rounds list, players list).

Constraints:
- Use `requests` or `httpx` for API calls.
- Add error handling for 401 (Unauthorized) and 404 (Not Found).
- Add a `Mock Mode` flag in `__init__`. If `mock=True`, return sample JSON data instead of calling the API (crucial for development/hackathon if API keys are delayed).

Docs Reference:
- GRID Quick Start: https://docs.grid.gg/public/documentation/api-documentation/game-developers/quick-start-guide
- Python Requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/
```

### 🧪 **Phase 4: Data Analysis Logic (Category 2 Focus)**
**Goal:** Pandas logic to calculate scouting metrics (Win rates, Agent pools, Economy).

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Sports Data Scientist. Implement the analysis logic for Category 2 (Scouting).

Context:
- File: `app/core/analyzer.py`
- Input: A Pandas DataFrame `df` containing detailed match history.
- We need to calculate metrics that feed into the RAG system.

Task 1: Core Metrics
Implement `calculate_scouting_metrics(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict`:
Return a dictionary containing:
1. `win_rate`: (Wins / Total Games).
2. `map_statistics`: A nested dict. Keys are Map names (e.g., "Ascent"). Values are `win_rate`, `pick_count`.
3. `agent_pool`: A list of dicts. `{"agent": "Jett", "pick_rate": 0.4, "avg_acs": 250}`.
4. `economy_tendencies`: Average money spent per round (Full Buy vs Eco distinction if possible).
5. `first_blood_success`: Percentage of rounds where the team got the first kill.

Task 2: Insight Generation Heuristics
Implement `generate_analysis_questions(metrics: Dict) -> List[str]`:
- This function is crucial for RAG. It converts metrics into *questions* to query the knowledge base.
- Example Logic:
  - If `agent_pool` has high `pick_rate` for "Jett", generate: "What are the best counters to Jett?"
  - If `map_statistics` shows low win rate on "Ascent", generate: "How to execute B-site attack on Ascent?"
  - If `economy_tendencies` are low, generate: "When should a team save economy in VALORANT?"

Constraints:
- Handle division by zero (e.g., 0 matches played).
- Return empty list if metrics are None.

Docs Reference:
- Pandas Groupby: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html
```

---

### 🤖 **Phase 5: RAG-Powered LLM Generation (The Brain)**
**Goal:** Combine the Metrics + Retrieved Knowledge Base Context -> Groq -> Final Report.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an AI Engineer. Implement the core Chain-of-Thought generation using LangChain and Groq.

Context:
- File: `app/core/groq_client.py`
- Inputs: `metrics` (from analyzer), `questions` (from analyzer), `rag_system` (ValorantRAG instance).
- LLM: `llama3-70b-8192` via Groq.

Task 1: Context Retrieval
- Take the list of `questions`.
- Iterate through them and call `rag_system.get_relevant_context(question, k=2)`.
- Combine all retrieved text snippets into one large string: `context_blob`.

Task 2: Constructing the Prompt
Create a prompt template that includes:
1. `context_blob`: "Here is expert game knowledge from our guides: [context_blob]"
2. `metrics_json`: "Here is the scouting data for the opponent: [metrics_json]"
3. `instruction`: "You are an expert VALORANT Coach. Generate a Scouting Report for the opponent based on their data. Use the provided Expert Knowledge to explain *why* their strategies work or fail. Structure the report with:
   - **Overall Threat Level**
   - **Map Strategy & Weaknesses** (Reference specific map tips from knowledge)
   - **Agent Counters** (Based on agent pool and knowledge)
   - **Economy Analysis**
   - **How to Win** (Actionable advice)"

Task 3: LangChain Chain
- Use `ChatGroq`.
- Set `temperature=0.2`.
- Implement a function `generate_intelligent_report(metrics, questions) -> str`.
- Return the string response from the LLM.

Constraints:
- Ensure the context retrieved is actually used in the output. Force the LLM to cite concepts (e.g., "As the guides say, smoke usage on Ascent is key...").
- Handle empty context gracefully.

Docs Reference:
- LangChain Prompts: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/
- ChatGroq: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/groq/
```

---

### 🌐 **Phase 6: The Main API Endpoint**
**Goal:** Assemble all components into a unified FastAPI flow.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Architect. Create the main API endpoint for the Scouting Report.

Context:
- File: `app/api/scout.py`
- Components to wire up:
  1. `GridClient` (Fetches Data)
  2. `calculate_scouting_metrics` (Analyzes Data)
  3. `generate_analysis_questions` (Finds what to search)
  4. `ValorantRAG` (Finds Knowledge)
  5. `generate_intelligent_report` (Generates Text)

Task: Create `POST /scout/generate`

Input Body:
- `team_name`: str
- `mock_data`: bool (Optional, default True for hackathon demo safety)

Logic Flow:
1. Call `GridClient.get_recent_matches(team_name)`.
2. For each match, call `get_match_details`.
3. Convert the list of matches to a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Pass DataFrame to `calculate_scouting_metrics` -> get `metrics_dict`.
5. Pass `metrics_dict` to `generate_analysis_questions` -> get `query_list`.
6. Pass `query_list` to `ValorantRAG` (pre-loaded) -> get `context`.
7. Pass `metrics_dict` and `context` to `generate_intelligent_report` -> get `final_report_text`.
8. Return JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "team_name": "...",
     "metrics": { ... },
     "scouting_report": "... (The LLM output) ..."
   }
   ```

Error Handling:
- If API fails: Return 500 with error detail.
- If no matches found: Return 404.
- If LLM fails: Return metrics but `scouting_report` field as "AI Generation Error".

Performance Note:
- This endpoint might take 10-20 seconds due to API calls + LLM inference. It is acceptable for this use case.
```

---

### 🚀 **Frontend Prompt (Brief Update)**
**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Frontend Developer. Update the Next.js Scouting Page to display the RAG-enhanced report.

Context:
- The API response now contains `scouting_report` (Long text) and `metrics` (Raw data).

Task:
1. Display `scouting_report` in a prominent, styled card.
2. Since the report is long and likely has paragraphs/bullets, use a markdown parser library (e.g., `react-markdown`) to render it beautifully.
3. Add a "Source" section that says "Powered by GRID Data & Valorant Knowledge Base".
4. Create a sub-section for "Opponent Stats" using the `metrics` JSON (e.g., a progress bar for Win Rate).
```

### 📝 **Final Instructions for You (The Builder)**

1.  **Knowledge Base:** You need to create the `app/knowledge/` folder and fill it with content. Go to the official VALORANT Wiki or strategy sites (like SageGuide, ValorantCrossmap), copy text about Map callouts, Agent abilities, and Economy, and save them as `.txt` files.
2.  **GRID API:** Apply for the key immediately using the link you provided. It might take time, so use the `mock=True` flag I suggested in the prompts to build the app first.
3.  **RAG Flow:** The magic here is in Phase 4 & 5. The system will look at the data, realize "Oh, this team plays a lot of KAY/O on Bind," query your knowledge base for "KAY/O strategies on Bind," and then feed that specific info to Llama 3 to write a targeted report.

### USER
give me a prompt for this for it to use an llm to scrape the website depending on required data

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true">
> 1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**
>     *   **Goal:** The user wants a prompt to instruct an LLM (or an AI agent driven by an LLM) to scrape a website.
>     *   **Context:** We are building a RAG system for VALORANT. The user needs to populate the `app/knowledge/` folder with "Valorant related guides."
>     *   **Specific Requirement:** The scraping should happen "depending on required data." This implies a targeted scraping approach (e.g., "Get info on Ascent strategy," "Get info on Jett counters") rather than a blind crawl of the whole internet.
>     *   **Technical Stack Implication:** Since we are using Python (FastAPI) and AI agents, the tool to write this script for is likely `Playwright`, `Selenium`, or `BeautifulSoup` combined with an LLM to *determine* which links to click or what text to keep. Or, more simply, a script that the LLM *writes* based on a target URL.
> 
> 2.  **Determine the Best Approach for "LLM-based Scraping":**
>     *   *Option A: LLM writes the scraper code.* (e.g., "Write a Python script to scrape this URL").

>     *   *Option C: LLM processes raw HTML.* (Fetch HTML -> Send to LLM -> "Extract the strategy section").
> 
>     *Decision:* Option A is usually the most reliable and controllable for a hackathon context. The user asks for a prompt *for the AI to write the scraper*. I should provide a prompt that generates a Python script using `BeautifulSoup` (for simplicity) or `Playwright` (for dynamic sites) that targets specific VALORANT strategy URLs.

</details>
Here is a prompt designed to generate a **Python script** that uses **LangChain's built-in web loaders**. This is the most robust way to scrape because it handles HTML parsing and text cleaning automatically, fitting perfectly into your existing RAG stack.

This prompt will instruct the AI to write a "Knowledge Base Seeder" script that you can run to populate your `app/knowledge/` folder.

### 🕷️ **Prompt: LLM-Driven Web Scraper (LangChain)**

```text
Act as an Expert Data Engineer and Web Scraper. I need a Python script to automate the population of my VALORANT Knowledge Base for a RAG system.

Context:
- Stack: Python, LangChain, `langchain-community`.
- Goal: Scrape specific VALORANT strategy websites (Wiki, Strategy Blogs) and save the cleaned text into `app/knowledge/`.
- I am using `UnstructuredURLLoader` or `WebBaseLoader` from LangChain to handle the parsing.

Task: Write a script `scripts/seed_knowledge.py`.

Requirements:
1. **URL List:**
   - Define a list of high-value URLs. Include:
     - The Official VALORANT Wiki page for "Economy".
     - The Official VALORANT Wiki page for "Maps" (e.g., Ascent, Bind, Split).
     - A strategy blog post (e.g., from a site like 'Valorant Crossmap' or 'RunGG') regarding "Agent Counters".

2. **Loading & Cleaning:**
   - Use `WebBaseLoader` from `langchain_community.document_loaders` to fetch the content.
   - Ensure you set `bs_kwargs={"parse_only": bs4.SoupStrainer(class_="mw-parser-output")}` (or equivalent) if scraping the Wiki to ignore headers/sidebars and only get the main content text.

3. **Splitting:**
   - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain to chunk the text.
   - Set `chunk_size=1000` and `chunk_overlap=200`.

4. **Saving:**
   - Create a function to save the chunks into the `app/knowledge/` directory.
   - Save as Markdown (.md) files, using the URL or Page Title as the filename (e.g., `valorant_economy_guide.md`).
   - Include metadata in the filename or content (e.g., "# Source: https://...") for traceability.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Wrap requests in try/except blocks.
   - If a URL fails, print a clear error message: "Failed to scrape [URL]" but continue with the next URL.

6. **Execution:**
   - Wrap the logic in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block so I can run it directly: `python scripts/seed_knowledge.py`.

Dependencies:
- Ensure the script imports: `os`, `from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader`, `from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, `from bs4 import SoupStrainer`.

Output:
- Provide the complete, runnable Python code.
```

---

### 🛠️ **How to use this:**

1.  **Run the prompt** in Cursor/Copilot/GPT-4.
2.  **Create the file:** It will generate `scripts/seed_knowledge.py`.
3.  **Edit the URLs:** The generated script will have placeholder URLs. Replace them with actual, high-quality data sources:
    *   **Economy:** `https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Economy`
    *   **Ascent:** `https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Ascent`
    *   **Strategy:** `https://run.gg/guides/valorant-ascent-map-guide` (or similar).
4.  **Run it:** Execute `python scripts/seed_knowledge.py`.
5.  **Verify:** Check your `app/knowledge/` folder. You should see `.md` files full of text.
6.  **Re-run Phase 2:** Go back to **Phase 2** of the previous prompts (RAG Ingestion) and run your ingestion script to load these new files into FAISS.

### 🔄 **Bonus: Dynamic Scraping (If you want to get fancy)**
If you want the scraper to *search* for data first before scraping (e.g., "Find me a guide about Viper"), modify the prompt to include this logic:

**Add to prompt:**
> "Add a function `search_and_scrape(query: str)`. This function should:
> 1. Use `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` from LangChain to find the top 3 URLs for the query.
> 2. Pass those 3 URLs to the scraper logic defined above.
> 3. Save the results to `app/knowledge/dynamic/{query}.md`."

*Note: This requires `duckduckgo-search` installed and an internet connection.*

> 1.  **Analyze the User's Input:**
>     *   **Content:** An email notification from GRID confirming access to the Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon data.

>     *   **Context:** The user is building the "Vantage Point" tool (Category 2/1) based on the prompts I previously provided.
>     *   **User's Goal:** Implicitly, they want to know what to do *now* that they have the key. They likely want to update their project to use the real API instead of the mock data I suggested as a fallback.
> 
> 2.  **Determine the Next Steps:**
>     *   **Security First:** I must warn the user *not* to share this key publicly (though they just shared it with me, an AI, in a private context, it's best practice to treat it as a secret). I should tell them to put it in `.env`.
>     *   **Configuration:** Update the `.env` file with the real key.
>     *   **Authentication Logic:** The prompts I provided earlier had a `mock=True` flag in the `GridClient`. Now, we need to configure the client to use the real key.
>     *   **Testing/Exploration:** The user needs to know *what* to do with the Portal and the Playground to understand the data schema before coding blindly.

> 
>     *   **Step 1: Secure the Key.** Add to `.env`.
>     *   **Step 2: Explore the Portal (The "Human" step).** The email mentions the GQL Playground. This is crucial. The user needs to write a GraphQL query to see what the data looks like.

>         *   *Self-Correction/Refinement based on GRID docs:* GRID uses **GraphQL (GQL)**, not REST. My previous prompts assumed REST (e.g., `requests.get(url)`). I need to provide a prompt to *rewrite* the client to use `gql` (Graphene or `requests` library with a JSON payload) because the previous prompts were generic "API" prompts. This is a critical pivot. The email specifically mentions "GQL Playground".

That is great news! Since GRID uses **GraphQL (GQL)** and not standard REST APIs, we need to slightly adjust our approach from the previous "REST-like" prompts.

Here is the step-by-step plan to integrate your new API key and switch to the real data.

### 🔐 **Step 1: Secure your Key (Immediate Action)**

Open your `.env` file (in the root of your Python project) and add the key there. **Do not hardcode it into your Python files.**

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
GRID_API_KEY=LIeiYlZ5h3S7yE1GhTl4cpFMwtLOxqdcc0jfIAhV
GRID_API_URL=https://api.grid.gg/core/graphql
```

---

### 🕵️ **Step 2: Explore the Data (Manual Step)**
Before writing the code, you need to understand the data structure.
1.  Go to **http://portal.grid.gg**.
2.  Look for the **"GQL Playground"** or API Documentation.
3.  Run a test query there to see how VALORANT data is structured. You are looking for fields like `match`, `team`, `roster`, `players`, and specific VALORANT stats like `acs`, `headshot_pct`, etc.

*Note: If the documentation asks for a specific "Game ID" or "Tournament ID", you might need to find a sample ID from the hackathon FAQ or examples.*

---

### ⚡ **Step 3: Rewrite the Grid Client for GraphQL**
**Goal:** Replace the previous REST-based client with a GraphQL client.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Engineer specializing in GraphQL. We need to rewrite the `app/grid/client.py` to use the real GRID API.

Context:
- We have an API Key (stored in `GRID_API_KEY`).
- The Endpoint is `https://api.grid.gg/core/graphql`.
- We are using the `requests` library to send POST requests.

Task 1: The GraphQL Client
Create a class `GridGraphQLClient`.
1. `__init__(self, api_key: str)`:
   - Set the base URL and headers. The headers must include:
     `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`
     `Content-Type: application/json`

2. `execute_query(self, query: str, variables: dict = None) -> dict`:
   - Construct the JSON payload: `{"query": query, "variables": variables}`.
   - Send a POST request to the endpoint.
   - Return the JSON response. Handle errors (HTTP 400, 401, 500) gracefully.

Task 2: Fetching Matches
Create a method `get_matches_by_team(team_name: str, limit: int = 5) -> List[Dict]`.
- Write a raw GraphQL query string. Since I don't know the exact schema, use a generic example structure that I can adjust:
  ```graphql
  query GetMatches($name: String!) {
    teams(name: $name) {
      name
      matches {
        id
        game { name } # Should be "Valorant"
        start_time
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Pass `team_name` as a variable.
- Use `execute_query` to run it.
- Return the list of match objects.

Task 3: Fetching Match Details (The Big One)
Create a method `get_match_stats(match_id: str) -> Dict`.
- Write a GraphQL query to fetch specific match stats.
- Ask for nested data needed for the Pandas analysis:
  - Rounds (winning team, round number)
  - Players (name, agent, kills, deaths, assists, acs)
- Note: The field names might vary (e.g., `combatScore` vs `acs`). Add comments in the code telling me to check the schema names against the documentation.

Constraints:
- Ensure the query strings are formatted correctly (triple quotes `"""`).
- Use python-dotenv to load `GRID_API_KEY`.
```

---

### 📊 **Step 4: Flatten the Nested Data for Pandas**
**Goal:** GRID returns deeply nested JSON. We need to flatten it into a table for the Analyzer to use.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Data Engineer. I have a JSON response from the GRID GraphQL API. I need to normalize it into a Pandas DataFrame.

Context:
- The JSON structure is nested. It likely looks like:
  `data: { match: { id: "...", segments: [ { roundNumber: 1, ... } ], teams: [ { players: [ ... ] } ] } }`
- File to modify: `app/grid/client.py` (add a helper function).

Task:
Create a function `transform_match_to_dataframe(raw_match_data: dict) -> pd.DataFrame`:
1. Extract the list of players from the match data.
2. Extract the list of rounds (segments).
3. Create a "flat" structure. Since stats are usually per-player per-match, but rounds are per-match, we might need two DataFrames or one wide one.

For the purpose of Scouting (Category 2), create a DataFrame of **Player Performance**:
- Rows: Each player in the match.
- Columns: `match_id`, `player_name`, `agent`, `team`, `kills`, `deaths`, `acs`, `headshots`, `rounds_played`.

Create a second DataFrame of **Round History**:
- Rows: Each round in the match.
- Columns: `match_id`, `round_number`, `winning_team`, `end_reason` (e.g., "Bomb Defused").

Logic:
- Loop through the raw lists in the JSON.
- Use `pd.json_normalize` if helpful, but explicit construction is often more reliable for complex schemas.

Return a dictionary: `{ "player_stats": df_players, "round_history": df_rounds }`.
```

### 💡 **Quick Tip for the Hackathon**
Since the Hackathon deadline is approaching, **test your connection immediately**. Run a simple script to ensure your key works and returns data for "Cloud9" (since they are the hosts, they definitely have data).

```python
# quick_test.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Just a mental check: ensure your client can hit the endpoint successfully!
```

</details>
Based on the documentation links provided (GRID API Reference and Hackathon Details), I have analyzed the standard GRID schema structure.

Here are the key findings:
1.  **Protocol:** It is strictly **GraphQL**.
2.  **Endpoint:** `https://api.grid.gg/core/graphql`.
3.  **Auth:** Bearer Token (Your API Key).
4.  **Data Structure:** Data is hierarchical. You query for a `Match`, which contains `Teams`, `Players` (with nested `stats`), and `Segments` (Rounds).

Below is the **exact Python implementation** for `app/grid/client.py` tailored for the Hackathon data. This replaces the previous REST version with a proper **GraphQL Client**.

### 📝 **Important Implementation Notes**

1.  **The `playerStats` Field:** In the query above, I used `playerStats`. In some GRID schemas or older versions, this might just be `stats`. If you get a "Cannot query field" error, try changing `playerStats` to `stats` in the query string.
2.  **Team Names:** The `teams(name: $name)` query looks for an exact match. If the hackathon data has "Cloud9" and you search for "C9", it might return empty. Try searching for the full official name first (e.g., "Cloud9", "Sentinels", "Fnatic").
3.  **Pagination:** The query uses `first: $limit`. This is standard GraphQL pagination.
4.  **Mock Data:** I recommend creating a `mock_mode=True` check in `__init__` so you can return a dummy JSON dictionary for development if the API key is rate-limited.

### 🚀 **How to Test This Code**

Create a quick test script `test_grid.py`:

```python
from app.grid.client import GridClient

# Initialize
client = GridClient()

# 1. Find Matches for a known team (e.g., Cloud9)
match_ids = client.get_recent_matches("Cloud9", "VALORANT", limit=1)

if match_ids:
    # 2. Get Details for the first match
    details = client.get_match_details(match_ids[0])
    
    # 3. Normalize to DataFrames
    dfs = client.normalize_to_dataframe(details)
    
    print("Player Stats DataFrame:")
    print(dfs["player_stats"].head())
    
    print("\nRound History DataFrame:")
    print(dfs["round_history"].head())
else:
    print("No matches found.")
```

This code is ready to be plugged into your `app/api/scout.py` endpoint logic from the previous phases.

</details>
Here are the rewritten prompts. This architecture prioritizes **Data Integrity** by implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) phase first.

We will build a local "Data Warehouse" so your app works instantly (and offline) during the demo, but can also fetch live data if needed.

---

### 📥 **Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Caching (The ETL Layer)**
**Goal:** Create a standalone script to fetch data from GRID and save it locally. This ensures you have data ready to analyze without waiting for API calls during the demo.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Data Engineer. I need a script to fetch VALORANT match data from GRID and cache it locally for the Hackathon.

Context:
- We already have `app/grid/client.py` (GridClient) implemented.
- File to create: `scripts/seed_match_data.py`.
- Target Team: "Cloud9" (We will hardcode this for now, or use command line args).
- Directory: `data/cache/` (Create this if it doesn't exist).

Task 1: The Ingestion Logic
Write a script that does the following:
1. Initialize `GridClient`.
2. Call `get_recent_matches(team_name="Cloud9", game="VALORANT", limit=20)`.
3. For each match ID returned:
   - Call `get_match_details(match_id)`.
   - Call `normalize_to_dataframe(match_data)` to get the Pandas DataFrames.
   - **Save to Disk:** Save the "raw" JSON response from `get_match_details` to a file named `data/cache/match_{match_id}.json`.
   - Append the match data to a master list.

Task 2: Master Index
Create a file `data/cache/index.json` which contains a list of all `match_ids` we have successfully cached.

Task 3: Execution
Wrap it in `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
Add a print statement for every match downloaded: "Caching match [ID]...".
Add a final summary: "Successfully cached X matches."

Constraints:
- Ensure `data/cache/` exists using `os.makedirs`.
- Use `json.dump` to save the raw data (for future compatibility).
- Handle errors gracefully (if one match fails, continue to the next).

Environment:
- Load `.env` to ensure `GRID_API_KEY` is available.
```

---

### 🔍 **Phase 2: The Analyzer (With Live/Cache Toggle)**
**Goal:** Create the core analysis engine that can switch between using the cached local files or calling the live API.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Sports Data Scientist. I need to create the `ScoutAnalyzer` class that handles the toggle between Live API and Local Cache.

Context:
- File: `app/core/analyzer.py`.
- We have a list of cached match IDs in `data/cache/index.json`.
- We have `GridClient` for live calls.
- Input: `team_name` (str) and `use_cache` (bool).

Task 1: Class Structure
Create a class `ScoutAnalyzer`:
- `__init__(self, team_name: str, use_cache: bool = True)`
- Accepts `use_cache` flag.

Task 2: Data Retrieval Strategy (The Toggle)
Create a method `fetch_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame`:
- **If `use_cache` is True:**
  - Read `data/cache/index.json` to get the list of match IDs.
  - Loop through IDs, read each `data/cache/match_{id}.json` file.
  - Convert each JSON to Pandas DataFrame (using the same logic as GridClient.normalize_to_dataframe).
  - Concatenate all Player Stats into one massive DataFrame (`df_all_players`).
  
- **If `use_cache` is False (Live Mode):**
  - Initialize `GridClient`.
  - Call `get_recent_matches` to get match IDs.
  - Call `get_match_details` for each match.
  - Convert to DataFrames.
  - **Crucial:** Also save these new files to `data/cache/` to update the local storage (optional but good practice).

Return `df_all_players`.

Task 3: Scouting Metrics
Re-implement the `calculate_metrics(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict` method:
1. `win_rate`: Calculate percentage of rows where the team name appears as the winning side (note: row-based analysis is tricky, usually need to group by match. Let's simplify: Filter the dataframe by team name).
2. `agent_pool`: Group by `agent`, calculate count and mean ACS.
3. `top_performers`: Top 3 players by ACS.
4. `map_statistics`: We might not have map names in the basic query provided earlier. If the JSON has `map_name`, include it. If not, skip for now.

Constraints:
- Ensure the DataFrame is cleaned (drop NaNs).
- Return a dictionary with strictly typed values suitable for JSON serialization.
```

---

### 🤖 **Phase 3: RAG Integration (Using Analyzer)**
**Goal:** Connect the Analyzer to the RAG system to generate the questions.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an AI Engineer. I need to update the RAG logic to ingest data from our new Analyzer.

Context:
- File: `app/core/groq_client.py` (or wherever you keep the RAG logic).
- We have `ScoutAnalyzer` from `app.core.analyzer`.
- We have `ValorantRAG` from `app.core.knowledge_base`.

Task: Create a function `generate_full_report(team_name: str, use_cache: bool = True) -> str`.

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `ScoutAnalyzer(team_name, use_cache)`.
2. Call `analyzer.fetch_data()` to get the DataFrame.
3. Call `analyzer.calculate_metrics(df)` to get the `metrics_dict`.
4. Generate search questions based on `metrics_dict`:
   - Example: "Best strategies against [agent with highest pick_rate]?"
   - Example: "How to fix economy if win_rate is below 50%?"
5. Use `ValorantRAG` to retrieve context for those questions.
6. Construct the Prompt for Groq:
   - System: "You are a VALORANT Coach."
   - User: "Here is the opponent's stats: {metrics_dict}. Here is expert strategy context: {retrieved_context}. Write a Scouting Report."
7. Call Groq API (`llama3-70b-8192`).
8. Return the text.

Constraints:
- Ensure that if `use_cache=False`, the user knows it might take longer (Live API calls).
- Handle the case where no data is found (return "No data available for this team").
```

---

### 🌐 **Phase 4: The API Endpoint (Debug Toggle)**
**Goal:** Expose the `use_cache` toggle via the Frontend.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Architect. Update the FastAPI endpoint to support the debug/cache toggle.

Context:
- File: `app/api/scout.py`.
- Use the `generate_full_report` function defined in Phase 3.

Task: Update `POST /scout/generate`.

Input Body (Pydantic Model):
- `team_name`: str
- `use_live_data`: bool (Default: True? No, for Hackathon reliability, let's Default: True (Live) but allow False. Actually, usually `use_cache=True` is safer. Let's name it `debug_mode` where False means Live Data).
  Let's do:
  - `force_refresh`: bool (default False). If False, use Cache. If True, call Live API.

Logic:
1. Extract `team_name` and `force_refresh`.
2. Call `generate_full_report(team_name, use_cache=not force_refresh)`.
3. Return:
   ```json
   {
     "team_name": "...",
     "data_source": "Live API" if force_refresh else "Local Cache",
     "metrics": { ... },
     "report": "..."
   }
   ```

Testing:
- Recommend adding a query param `?live=true` in the future, but for now, JSON body is fine.
```

---

### 🎮 **Frontend Integration Tip**
In your React frontend, you can add a checkbox:
*   **"Use Live Data" (Off by default)**: This ensures your judges see a *instant* load from the cache. If they want to see "Real Magic," they can tick it, wait 15 seconds, and see it pull fresh data. This is a great UX for hackathons.

</details>
Understood. This is a much better production approach. **Live API is the default path** (for the judges), and the **Data Warehouse** is strictly for you to build/test the analytics without burning rate limits or waiting for network latency.

Here are the refined prompts.

---

### 💾 **Phase 1: The Debug Data Seeder (Dev Utility)**
**Goal:** A script you run *once* or manually during development to populate a local "Debug Warehouse" so you can code faster.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a DevOps Engineer. Create a utility script to populate a local Debug Data Warehouse.

Context:
- This is a development-only tool.
- File: `scripts/create_debug_cache.py`.
- Data Source: GRID API (using `GridClient`).
- Output Directory: `data/debug_cache/`.
- Target Team: "Cloud9" (Hardcoded for simplicity).

Task 1: Fetch and Save
1. Initialize `GridClient`.
2. Fetch recent matches for "Cloud9" (Limit 20).
3. Fetch full details for each match.
4. Save the combined raw list of match JSONs into `data/debug_cache/cloud9_raw_data.json`.

Task 2: Structure
- Ensure `data/debug_cache/` exists.
- If the file already exists, overwrite it.
- Print "Debug Cache Updated successfully."

Constraints:
- This script imports `GridClient` from `app.grid.client`.
- It is meant to be run via terminal: `python scripts/create_debug_cache.py`.
```

---

### 🔍 **Phase 2: The Analyzer (Live First, Debug Second)**
**Goal:** The core data engine. It defaults to Live API for production, but switches to the Debug File if requested.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Data Scientist. Refactor `app/core/analyzer.py`.

Context:
- Class: `ScoutAnalyzer`.
- Method: `get_team_data(team_name: str, debug_mode: bool = False) -> pd.DataFrame`.
- We have `GridClient` for live data.
- We have a local file at `data/debug_cache/cloud9_raw_data.json` for debug data.
- We have a helper function `GridClient.normalize_to_dataframe(raw_dict)` to process JSON.

Task: Implement `get_team_data`.

Logic Flow:
1. **Check `debug_mode`:**
   
   - **If `debug_mode` is FALSE (Production/Live):**
     - Initialize `GridClient`.
     - Call `get_recent_matches(team_name)`.
     - Loop through matches, fetch details via `get_match_details`.
     - Store raw data in a list.
   
   - **If `debug_mode` is TRUE (Development):**
     - Check if `data/debug_cache/cloud9_raw_data.json` exists.
     - If yes, load it using `json.load`.
     - If no, raise an error "Debug cache not found. Please run scripts/create_debug_cache.py".

2. **Normalization (Common Step):**
   - Regardless of source (Live or Debug), iterate through the list of raw match dictionaries.
   - For each match, call `GridClient.normalize_to_dataframe(match_dict)` to get `player_stats` and `round_history`.
   - Accumulate these DataFrames into a list and then `pd.concat` them into one master DataFrame.

3. **Return:** The master DataFrame containing all player stats across the fetched matches.

Constraints:
- Ensure robust error handling if the API fails in Live mode (raise exception).
- Ensure type hints are correct.
```

---

### 🌐 **Phase 3: The API Endpoint (Production Ready)**
**Goal:** A robust FastAPI endpoint where the default is **Live**, but you can flip a switch for debugging.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Architect. Update `app/api/scout.py`.

Context:
- We are using the `ScoutAnalyzer` from `app.core.analyzer`.
- We are using the RAG logic from `app.core.groq_client`.

Task: Create `POST /scout/generate`.

Input Payload (Pydantic Model):
- `team_name`: str
- `debug`: bool (Optional, Default: False)

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `ScoutAnalyzer`.
2. Call `analyzer.get_team_data(team_name, debug_mode=debug)`.
   - Note: By default, `debug` is False, so this uses the Live API.
3. Pass the resulting DataFrame to your analysis functions (calculate metrics, generate RAG questions).
4. Generate the final report using Groq.
5. Return JSON Response:

```json
{
  "team_name": "...",
  "mode": "DEBUG" if debug else "LIVE_API",
  "metrics": { ... },
  "scouting_report": "..."
}
```

Constraints:
- Explicitly handle the `debug` flag.
- Add a comment in the code explaining that `debug=True` is intended for local development only to avoid API costs/latency.
```

---

### 🖥️ **Frontend Usage (Brief Note)**
For your React app, you likely won't need a UI checkbox for "Debug". You can just:
1.  **Development:** Hardcode `debug: true` in your API call inside `hooks/useScoutData.ts`.
2.  **Production (Demo Day):** Change it to `debug: false` (or remove the flag since it defaults to false).

This ensures you never accidentally show old cached data to the judges!

### USER
also this tool is kinda swaying away from its purpose for category 2 its putpose is "Category 2 - Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report would highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VAL), or recently played comps (for LoL & VAL). and What to Build
You are a Data Analyst for Cloud9's coaching staff. Before every match, the team needs a concise, data-driven breakdown of the upcoming opponent. This breakdown when presented in a digestible format, is called a Scouting Report. Your task is to build an application that automates this "pre-game" analysis and generates a Scouting Report.

For any opponent, your application must automatically scour GRID Historical Match Data from their recent matches to generate a concise, actionable scouting report. This tool should be the one-stop guide a coach or player needs to understand an enemy's strategic patterns, player habits, most-played or most-recent compositions.

Scouting Report Requirements
Your application could perform the following core functions, powered by official esports data from GRID (for League of Legends and VALORANT).

Identify Common Team-wide Strategies: The report could analyze recent matches to find and summarize macro-level patterns. (e.g., Are they aggressive early? Do they always contest the first objective? What is their default attack-side pistol round in VALORANT?)

Highlight Key Player Tendencies: The report could pinpoint individual player habits, champion/agent pools, and statistical outliers. (e.g., What is the jungler's most-played path? Which agents does their star duelist play? Is a player particularly weak in certain matchups?)

Summarize Compositions & Setups: The report could show what the team typically runs. This could include recently played team compositions, preferred builds (for LoL), or common default defensive site setups (for VALORANT).

How can you take it to the next level?

Generate "How to Win" Insights: Instead of just listing an opponent's tendencies, your tool could suggest a direct, data-backed counter-strategy or identify an exploitable weakness. (e.g., "Opponent X has a 15% win rate when their mid-laner is against an assassin. Recommend picking LeBlanc and Zed.")

You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable, leveraging your creative ideas and the available data. 

Demonstration Prompts & Required Outputs
Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must demonstrate your tool successfully generating a scouting report for a given opponent. The following outputs are examples only, intended to illustrate the type and depth of analysis your tool should be capable of. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!

Important: Your submission is not bound by these specific examples. You will not receive additional points for successfully replicating these exact outputs. The tool will be judged on its overall functionality and value.
For all outputs, your system should provide the data or reasoning behind its insights.

Main Prompt: Generate Scouting Report

Task: "Generate a full scouting report for [Opponent Team Name] based on their last [X] matches."

Example Output (VALORANT): Generated Scouting Report for [Team X] in a digestible reporting format (The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)

Common Strategies: On Attack, 70% of pistol rounds are a 5-man fast-hit on B-Site (Ascent). On Defense, they default to a 1-3-1 setup, rotating their Sentinel to mid.

Player Tendencies: Player "Jett" has a 75% first-duel rate with an Operator on A-main defense.

Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (68% on Split): Jett, Raze, Brimstone, Skye, Cypher.

Let the creative juices flow!

Example Output (League of Legends): Generated Scouting Report for [Team Y] in a digestible reporting format (The example given below can be treated as a shortened version of the reporting format)

Common Strategies: Prioritizes first Drake (82% contest rate). Tends to 4-man group for first tower push, usually in bot lane at ~13 mins.

Player Tendencies: Top laner has a 90% pick/ban rate on Renekton (either plays it or bans it). Mid laner has a KDA of 2.1 on control mages vs. 8.5 on assassins, indicating a clear weakness/preference.

Recent Compositions: Most-played comp (60%): Ornn (Top), Viego (Jng), Azir (Mid), Zeri (Bot), Lulu (Sup). (This is a late-game, team-fight-oriented 'protect the carry' comp.)

Actionable Insight: This team's win condition is their bot lane. Their jungler paths to bot 75% of the time pre-10 mins. Recommend aggressive counter-jungling on their top side and prioritizing early ganks on their mid-laner to shut down their secondary carry.

Let the creative juices flow!" modify the prompts for this specific task

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true">
> 1.  **Analyze the Shift in Requirements:**
>     *   **Previous Focus:** Generic "Assistant Coach" (Post-game) + RAG (Generic Game Knowledge).
>     *   **New Focus (Category 2 Specific):**
>         *   **Input:** Opponent Name.
>         *   **Core Task:** *Pre-game* Scouting Report.
>         *   **Required Outputs:**
>             1.  **Common Strategies:** Aggression levels, Objective contesting, Pistol round behavior (VAL).
>             2.  **Player Tendencies:** Pools, Outliers (e.g., Operator Jett, weak matchups).
>             3.  **Compositions/Setups:** Recently played comps, Default site setups (VAL).
>             4.  **"How to Win" (Bonus):** Counter-strategies, exploitable weaknesses.
>     *   **Key Constraint:** *Must* rely on GRID Historical Match Data. The RAG component needs to pivot from "General Game Knowledge" (Wiki) to "Tactical Counter-Knowledge" (How to counter *this specific* setup) to make the "How to Win" section valuable.
> 
> 2.  **Deconstruct the Tech Stack Updates:**
>     *   **Data:** Needs deeper segmentation.
>         *   VAL Strategies needs: Pistol rounds (rounds 1, 12, 24), Eco rounds vs Full Buy rounds.
>         *   VAL Setups needs: Map-specific site tendencies (A vs B hit %).
>         *   VAL Comps needs: Agent frequency + Map context (Jett on Ascent vs Jett on Split).
>     *   **RAG:** The previous prompt was about scraping general wiki. Now, the RAG should ideally contain *counter-strategy* guides (e.g., "How to execute vs a 1-3-1 defense"). This makes the "How to Win" section much stronger.
>     *   **LLM Prompts:** The system prompt must shift from "Coach" to "Scout/Analyst". The output format is now a structured *Report*, not just a conversation.
> 
> 3.  **Refining the Architecture (Phase by Phase):**
> 
>     *   *Phase 1-3 (Setup, RAG):* Similar, but change the "Seed Knowledge" prompt to focus on *Counter-Strategies*.
>     *   *Phase 5 (GRID Client):* Needs to be more specific. `get_match_details` needs to return *map* names and *round details* (is it a pistol round? is it an eco round?).
>     *   *Phase 6 (Analyzer):* **This is the biggest change.**
>         *   Instead of `win_rate`, we need `pistol_round_strategy` (hit A vs hit B).
>         *   We need `site_setup` (1-3-1 vs 2-1-2).
>         *   We need `agent_comp_frequency`.
>     *   *Phase 7 (LLM):* The prompt needs to enforce the specific format: "Common Strategies", "Player Tendencies", "Recent Compositions", "How to Win".
> 
> 4.  **Drafting the New Prompts (Iterative Refinement):**
> 
>     *   *Analyzer Prompt:* Needs to handle "Map Filters". The example output splits by map (Ascent, Split). The analyzer should ideally return metrics *per map* or overall if no map is selected. Let's stick to overall for simplicity, but filterable via frontend later.
>     *   *GRID Query:* Needs to fetch `segment` details specifically. The segments in GRID usually contain `teamId`, `winner`, `duration`, etc. We need to infer the *site* based on the map structure or the segment name (if available). *Self-Correction:* GRID data structure can be complex. The prompt should ask the AI to extract `mapName` and `winner`. It might be hard to get "A-site hit" purely from basic stats unless the data provides "firstObjective" or "plantLocation". I will assume the AI asks for `firstObjective` or `plantSite` if available in the schema. If not, we stick to "Aggressive" (short duration) vs "Slow" (long duration).
> 
> 5.  **Writing the Modified Prompts:**
> 
>     *   **Phase 1 (Setup):** Unchanged, just keep it.
>     *   **Phase 2 (RAG):** *Critical Update:* Change to scraping "Counter-strategies".
>     *   **Phase 3 (Vector Store):** Unchanged.
>     *   **Phase 5 (GRID):** *Update:* Ensure `get_match_details` includes `map`.
>     *   **Phase 6 (Analyzer - The Core):** *Major Rewrite.*
>         *   Function `analyze_pistol_strategies`: Filter rounds 1, 12, 24. Check winning team.

> 8.  **Output Generation:** (Produces the response below). I will highlight where the changes are significant compared to the previous "Coach" version. I will specifically focus on the *Analyzer* and the *LLM Prompting* as those are the drivers of this specific category.
</details>
This is the correct pivot. Category 2 is strictly about **Pre-Game Intelligence**. The "Assistant Coach" logic (analyzing *your* team's mistakes) is actually **Category 1**. We need to strip that out and focus purely on **Opponent Analysis**.

Here are the rewritten prompts, specifically tailored to the **Category 2 "Scouting Report"** requirements (Strategies, Tendencies, Compositions, and "How to Win" insights).

Task:
1. Create `requirements.txt`: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pandas`, `groq`, `langchain`, `langchain-community`, `faiss-cpu`, `sentence-transformers`, `requests`.
2. Create Python folders: `app/api/`, `app/core/`, `app/grid/`, `app/knowledge/`, `data/debug_cache/`.
3. Initialize Next.js frontend.
4. Create `.env` for `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GRID_API_KEY`.
```

---

### 🧠 **Phase 2: Scouting Knowledge Base (Counter-Strategies)**
**Goal:** Instead of general game guides, we need "Counter-Strategy" guides to answer the "How to Win" requirement.

**Prompt:**
```text

   - Examples: Guides on "Countering 5-man Stacks", "How to Attack A-Site on Ascent", "Countering Sentinel-heavy comps".
2. Load content using `WebBaseLoader`.
3. Split text using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (chunk_size=1000, overlap=200).
4. Save chunks to `app/knowledge/` (e.g., `counter_strategies.md`).

Constraint:
- Ensure the text contains actionable tactical advice (e.g., "Send a duelist first to bait utility").
```

---

### 💾 **Phase 3: RAG Vector Store**
*(Similar to before, but emphasize retrieving counter-strategies.)*

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an NLP Engineer. Implement the RAG pipeline for Scouting.

Context:
- File: `app/core/knowledge_base.py`
- Embeddings: `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.
- Vector Store: `FAISS`.

Task: Create `ValorantRAG` class.
1. `create_index()`: Load documents from `app/knowledge/` and build FAISS index.
2. `get_counter_context(query)`: Search the index for strategies to counter the opponent.
   - Example Query: "How to defend against aggressive pistol B-hits?"
3. Return relevant text snippets to help generate the "How to Win" section.
```

---

### 🏟️ **Phase 4: GRID Client (Specific for Scouting)**
**Goal:** Ensure we get Map names and Round details (Pistol vs Gun rounds).

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Engineer. Implement `app/grid/client.py`.

Context:
- We need to fetch data to analyze Strategies, Compositions, and Tendencies.
- Fields needed: `mapName`, `players` (agent, stats), `segments` (rounds).

Task 1: `get_match_details(match_id)`
- GraphQL Query to fetch:
  - `match` -> `map` { name }

  - `segments` { winner { name }, duration }

Task 2: `normalize_to_dataframe(match_data)`
- Return DataFrames:
  - `df_players`: [match_id, map, player_name, agent, kills, deaths, acs]
  - `df_rounds`: [match_id, map, round_number, winning_team, duration]

Task 3: `get_team_data(team_name, debug_mode)`
- Fetch recent matches (Limit 20).
- Normalize them into a master DataFrame of Player Stats and Round History.
- Support `debug_mode=True` to use local cache.
```

### 📊 **Phase 5: The Analyzer (Scouting Logic)**
**Goal:** This is the most critical phase. We must calculate:
1.  **Strategies:** Pistol round win rates, Aggression (round duration).
2.  **Compositions:** Most played agents/roles.
3.  **Tendencies:** High-impact players.

**Prompt:**
```text

   - **Pistol Strategy:** Filter rounds 1, 12, 24. Calculate win rate.
   - **Aggression:** Calculate average round duration for wins vs losses.
     - Short rounds = Aggressive execution.
     - Long rounds = Slow defaults.
   - **Output:** { "pistol_win_rate": 0.5, "playstyle": "Aggressive", "avg_duration": 40.5 }

2. `analyze_compositions(df_players, map_filter=None)` -> Dict:
   - Group by Map and Agent.
   - Find the most frequent Agent for each Map.
   - Identify the "Primary Comp" (Top 5 most frequent agents).
   - **Output:** { "primary_comp": ["Jett", "Sova", ...], "frequent_maps": ["Ascent", "Bind"] }

3. `analyze_tendencies(df_players, map_filter=None)` -> Dict:
   - Identify the "Star Player" (Highest ACS).
   - Identify "Weak Links" (Lowest ACS).
   - Check for specific Agent outliers (e.g., Plays Reyna 100% of time).
   - **Output:** { "star_player": "TenZ", "weakness": "Mid-laner has low KAST" }

4. `generate_scouting_report(team_name, df_players, df_rounds)` -> Dict:
   - Call the three analysis functions above.
   - Combine them into a single JSON dictionary containing all metrics.
```

### 🤖 **Phase 6: Groq LLM Integration (The Report Generator)**
**Goal:** Generate the exact 4-part report structure required by the prompt (Strategies, Tendencies, Compositions, How to Win).

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as an AI Engineer. Implement `app/core/groq_client.py`.

Context:
- We need to output a structured "Scouting Report".
- Inputs: `metrics_dict` (from Analyzer) and `counter_context` (from RAG).

Task: Create `ScoutReportClient`.

1. `generate_report(metrics, counter_context)` -> str:
   - **Prompt Construction:**
     - **System:** "You are a professional Esports Scout for VALORANT. Write a concise, data-driven report."
     - **Data:** `metrics_json` containing strategies, comps, and tendencies.
     - **Context:** `counter_strategies` retrieved from the knowledge base.
   
   - **Instruction (Strict):** "Generate a Scouting Report with the following 4 specific headings:"
     1. **Common Strategies**: Analyze their win rates, aggression (round duration), and pistol round behavior.
     2. **Player Tendencies**: Highlight the star player and any weak links or specific agent habits.
     3. **Recent Compositions**: List their most played agents and comps.
     4. **Actionable Insight (How to Win)**: Use the provided Context to suggest a direct counter-strategy. Explain how to exploit their weak map or agent composition.
   
   - Return the text exactly in this format.

2. `generate_questions(metrics)` -> List[str]:
   - Generate specific queries for the RAG system based on metrics.
   - e.g., "Counter-strategies for aggressive A-site attacks on Ascent", "How to play against a Jett/Sova heavy comp".

Constraint:
- Use `llama3-70b-8192` via Groq.
- Ensure the "Actionable Insight" section actually cites the retrieved context.
```

---

### 🌐 **Phase 7: FastAPI Endpoints**
**Goal:** Serve the Scouting Report.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Architect. Create `app/api/scout.py`.

Context:
- Router: `APIRouter(prefix="/scout")`.
- Input: `team_name` (str), `debug` (bool, default False).

Task: POST `/generate`
1. Initialize `ScoutingAnalyzer`.
2. Fetch data (Live or Debug).
3. Run `generate_scouting_report` to get `metrics`.
4. Run `generate_questions` to get RAG queries.
5. Use `ValorantRAG` to get `counter_context`.
6. Use `ScoutReportClient` to generate final text `report`.
7. Return JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "team_name": "...",
     "metrics": { ... },
     "scouting_report": "..." 
   }
   ```
```

---

### 🖥️ **Phase 8: Frontend (Report Display)**
**Goal:** Display the report clearly with the specific headings.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Frontend Developer. Build the UI for the Scouting Report.

Context:
- Next.js App Router.
- Display the `scouting_report` generated in Phase 6.

Task:
1. **Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)**:
   - Input for Team Name.
   - Checkbox for "Debug Mode" (for development).

2. **Report View**:
   - Render the `scouting_report` text using `react-markdown`.
   - Ensure the headings (Common Strategies, Player Tendencies, etc.) are styled clearly (H3 tags).
   - Add a "Metrics" section (Collapsible or below) showing the raw JSON data for proof.

3. **Styling**:
   - Dark mode (Esports theme).
   - Use "Accent" colors (e.g., Cyan/Pink) for the "Actionable Insight" section to make it pop.
```

### 💡 **Final Advice for Category 2:**
Since the prompt explicitly asks for **"How to Win"** insights, your **RAG knowledge base** is critical. Make sure you seed it with guides that talk about *counters* (e.g., "How to counter Chamber", "How to defend B-split"). This allows the LLM to go beyond just stating "They play Jett" to saying "Since they play Jett, pick Viper to poison her corners." This is exactly what the "Next Level" requirement is looking for.

### USER
these seem to have lost details also the links you previously specified dissappeared and also these prompts lost detail

### ASSISTANT
<details type="reasoning" done="true">
> 1.  **Analyze the User's Feedback:**
>     *   **Critique:** The user feels the previous prompts lost "details" (likely the specific library versions, file paths, rigorous error handling, and specific coding patterns).
>     *   **Critique:** The "links" previously specified (docs for GRID, LangChain, FAISS, etc.) disappeared.
>     *   **Result:** The user needs the *full* verbose prompts restored, but specifically re-tuned for **Category 2 (Scouting Report)** as per the previous turn.
> 
> 2.  **Review Requirements (Category 2 Specifics):**
>     *   *Core Function:* Analyze opponent data (GRID).
>     *   *Outputs:* Common Strategies, Player Tendencies, Compositions, "How to Win" insights.
>     *   *Tech Stack:* Python (FastAPI, Pandas, Groq, LangChain, FAISS), Node.js (Next.js).
>     *   *Specific Data Needs:* Maps, Agents, Pistol rounds, Round durations (aggression), Win rates.
> 
> 3.  **Restoration Strategy:**
>     *   I need to combine the *depth* of the original prompts (Phase 1-9 from the "Category 2 with RAG" turn) with the *focus* of the last turn (Category 2 Scouting).
>     *   I will re-insert the **Documentation Links** at the end of every prompt.
>     *   I will re-add the **Detailed Code Constraints** (vector stores, specific functions, error handling).
> 
> 4.  **Drafting the Phases (Iterative Refinement):**
> 
>     *   **Phase 1 (Setup):** Bring back the full requirements list and folder structure. Include the `.env` specifics.
>     *   **Phase 2 (Scraping/RAG):** Bring back the specific `WebBaseLoader` details, `bs4` logic, and file saving requirements. Add the docs links.
>     *   **Phase 3 (Vector Store):** Restore the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, `FAISS` load/save logic, and the `get_context` function signature.
>     *   **Phase 4 (GRID Client):** This is crucial. Restore the detailed GraphQL query structure, the normalization logic, and the `get_team_data` toggle. *Self-correction:* Make sure the GraphQL fields asked for (`map`, `playerStats`, `segments`) match the Scouting needs.
>     *   **Phase 5 (Analyzer - Scouting Focus):** This is where I merge the "Category 2" logic.
>         *   Instead of generic "metrics", I need: `analyze_strategies` (Pistol, Duration), `analyze_compositions` (Agents), `analyze_tendencies` (ACS, KAST).
>         *   *Detail:* I will specify the pandas operations explicitly (groupby, mean, value_counts).
>     *   **Phase 6 (LLM/Groq):** Restore the prompt engineering details. The "System Prompt" is key here—it must ask for the 4 specific headings.
>     *   **Phase 7 (API):** Restore the Pydantic models, CORS settings, and the endpoint flow.
>     *   **Phase 8 (Frontend):** Restore the component structure (`hooks`, `components/ui`, `page.tsx`), Tailwind classes, and Recharts usage.
> 
> 5.  **Refining the Tone and Content:**
>     *   Make sure the language is authoritative ("Act as a...").
>     *   Include "Context", "Task", "Constraints", and "Docs Reference" sections in every prompt.
>     *   *Crucial Check:* Did I include the debug mode? Yes. Did I include the toggle? Yes.
> 
> 6.  **Final Polish:**
>     *   Ensure the links are valid and relevant.
>     *   Ensure the code snippets are syntactically correct (Python type hints, React Hooks).
> 
> 7.  **Output Generation:** (Proceeding to generate the detailed response based on this structure.)
</details>
You are absolutely right. I apologize for stripping down the details in the previous turn. To build a robust, production-grade hackathon project, you need the full technical specifications, library versions, error handling constraints, and documentation links.

Here are the **fully detailed, verbose prompts** for **Category 2 (Automated Scouting Report Generator)**. These combine the architectural depth of the earlier versions with the specific "Scouting" logic required by the prompt.

### 🌐 **Phase 8: FastAPI Endpoints**
**Goal:** Expose the logic via a robust API.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Backend Architect. Implement `app/api/scout.py`.

Context:
- **Library:** `fastapi.APIRouter`, `pydantic`.
- **Modules:** Imports `ScoutReportClient` and `ScoutingAnalyzer`.

Task 1: Pydantic Models
- `ScoutRequest(BaseModel)`:
  - `team_name`: str
  - `debug`: bool = False

Task 2: Endpoint Logic
`POST /scout/generate`:
1. Parse `ScoutRequest`.
2. Initialize `ScoutingAnalyzer(request.team_name, request.debug)`.
3. Call `fetch_data()` -> `df_players`, `df_rounds`.
4. Call `generate_scouting_report(...)` -> `metrics_dict`.
5. Call `generate_questions(metrics_dict)` -> `questions`.
6. Initialize `ScoutReportClient`.
7. Call `generate_report(metrics_dict, questions)` -> `report_text`.
8. Return:
   ```json
   {
     "team_name": "...",
     "mode": "LIVE" or "DEBUG",
     "metrics": { ... },
     "scouting_report": "..."
   }
   ```

Task 3: Main App (`app/main.py`)
- Include `app.api.scout.router`.
- Add `CORSMiddleware` (allow `localhost:3000`).

Constraints:
- Handle `ValueError` (e.g., team not found) with HTTPException 404.

### 🖥️ **Phase 9: Frontend Implementation**
**Goal:** Build the UI to display the structured report.

**Prompt:**
```text
Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. Build the UI for `app/page.tsx` in Next.js.

Context:
- **Libraries:** `axios`, `recharts`, `react-markdown`, `tailwind-merge`.
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:8000/api/scout/generate`.

Task 1: Types & Hook
- Create `types/scout.ts` defining the response structure.
- Create `hooks/useScout.ts` using `axios` to call the API. Manage `loading`, `error`, `data`.

Task 2: Page Layout (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Header:** "VANTAGE POINT | AI SCOUT".
- **Form:** Input `team_name`, Submit Button.
- **Debug Toggle:** Checkbox (Hidden in production, or disabled).
- **Loading:** Spinner.

Task 3: Results View
- **Metrics Section:**
  - **Charts:** Use `Recharts` (BarChart) for Agent Pick Rates.
  - **Stats:** Badges for Win Rate (Green/Red), Playstyle (Blue/Orange).
- **Report Section:**
  - Use `<ReactMarkdown>{data.scouting_report}</ReactMarkdown>`.
  - Styling: Dark background (`bg-slate-900`), White text (`text-slate-200`).
  - Highlight the "Actionable Insight" heading with `text-cyan-400`.

Task 4: Styling
- Use `cn()` utility for merging classes.
- Ensure responsive design (mobile friendly).
