Vantage Point: Product Requirements Document
AI-Driven VALORANT Intelligence Platform for Sky's the Limit Hackathon

1. Executive Summary
Vantage Point is an AI-powered esports analytics platform designed for VALORANT competitive teams. The system transforms raw match telemetry from GRID API into actionable strategic intelligence through a two-phase development approach: starting with an Automated Scouting Report Generator (Category 2) and evolving into a comprehensive Assistant Coach (Category 1).

Key Objectives:
• Phase 1 (Days 1-5): Deliver a fully functional Category 2 Scouting Report Generator
• Phase 2 (Days 6-10): Extend to Category 1 Assistant Coach with micro-error detection
• Prize Target: $6,000 cash + GDC trip + Cloud9 swag + JetBrains licenses
• Deadline: February 3, 2026

2. Product Vision & Strategy
2.1 Problem Statement
Professional VALORANT teams generate massive amounts of match data but lack tools to convert this data into immediately actionable strategic insights. Coaches spend hours manually reviewing VODs to identify opponent tendencies and player mistakes. Current analytics tools provide statistics without context or strategic recommendations.

2.2 Solution Overview
Vantage Point uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine quantitative analytics with qualitative strategic knowledge. The system:

• Automatically fetches and analyzes opponent match history from GRID API
• Detects statistical anomalies and strategic patterns
• Generates natural language reports with specific counter-strategies
• Provides visual analytics through interactive charts and graphs

3. Technical Architecture
3.1 System Overview

4. Feature Requirements
4.1 Phase 1: Automated Scouting Report (Category 2)
Priority: P0 (Must Have for Submission)

FR-1.1: Team Search and Selection
• User inputs opponent team name (e.g., 'Sentinels', 'Cloud9')
• Optional map filter (e.g., 'Ascent', 'Haven')
• System validates team exists in GRID database
• Loading state with progress indicator

FR-1.2: Data Fetching and Caching
• Fetch last 20-50 matches from GRID API via GraphQL
• Cache results locally in data/debug_cache/ as JSON files
• Debug mode toggle to use cached data during development
• Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully

FR-1.3: Strategic Analysis Metrics
The system must calculate and display:

• Win Rate by Map (percentage across all analyzed matches)
• Site Attack Preference (A, B, C site statistics)
• Aggression Index (calculated from average round duration)
• Agent Composition Frequency (top 5 most-picked agents)
• Role Distribution (Duelist, Controller, Initiator, Sentinel percentages)
• Economy Patterns (Eco/Force Buy/Full Buy round distribution)

FR-1.4: AI-Generated Insights
Generate natural language report with four sections:

• Strategies: Overall playstyle (Rush vs Default vs Slow)
• Tendencies: Statistical patterns (site preference, timing)
• Compositions: Agent synergies and role balance
• How to Win: RAG-powered counter-strategies from VALORANT guides

FR-1.5: Data Visualization
• Bar chart: Agent pick rates
• Line chart: Win rate trend over last 20 matches
• Radar chart: Role distribution balance
• Color-coded heatmap for site preferences

4.2 Phase 2: Assistant Coach Upgrade (Category 1)
Priority: P1 (Extension if Time Permits)

FR-2.1: Match-Specific Analysis
• User selects specific match ID from team history
• System fetches granular event logs (kill feed, buy phase)
• Display round-by-round timeline (Win/Loss/Draw)

FR-2.2: Micro-Error Detection
Implement heuristic algorithms to detect:

• Free Deaths: Player dies within 15 seconds with 0 impact
• Bad Economy: Force buying when team has <4000 credits
• Role Failures: Duelist with low First Blood %, Controller dying first
• Utility Waste: High-value abilities unused before round end

FR-2.3: Impact Scoring
• Assign weighted impact scores to each error type
• Correlate high impact rounds with round losses
• Generate 'Root Cause' summary linking micro to macro outcomes

FR-2.4: Interactive Timeline UI
• Horizontal round strip with color coding (Green=Win, Red=Loss)
• Click round to open modal with detected errors
• Show specific player names, timestamps, and error descriptions
