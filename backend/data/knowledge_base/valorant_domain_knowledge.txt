VALORANT Strategy and Metrics Cheat Sheet

Round Structure
- Matches are first to 13 rounds (24 in regulation).
- Sides swap after round 12.
- Round phases: buy phase (45s), action phase (100s), post-plant (45s).

Economy States (per player)
- Eco: under 2000 credits. Minimal buys, expect low win odds.
- Force: 2000 to 3899 credits. Risky buy to break enemy economy or swing momentum.
- Full: 3900+ credits. Rifles, armor, full utility.

Role Expectations and KPIs
- Duelist: entry and first bloods. Track first blood percent and entry success.
- Controller: smokes and survival. Track KAST and early deaths (avoid dying first).
- Initiator: intel and setup. Track assists, damage per round, flash assists.
- Sentinel: defensive anchor. Track KAST, multi-kills on defense, trap value.

Playstyle Taxonomy (by round duration)
- Rush: under 40s average. Fast hits, often eco or force rounds.
- Default: 40s to 80s. Standard map control then exec.
- Slow: over 80s. Late executes, heavy utility trading.

Map and Site Notes
- Ascent: A/B, mid control, doors and open sightlines.
- Bind: A/B, no mid, teleporters enable fast rotations.
- Haven: A/B/C, three-site map, rotation timing is critical.
- Split: A/B, vertical fights, tight chokepoints.
- Icebox: A/B, verticality and long angles.
- Breeze: A/B, large open spaces and long sightlines.
- Fracture: A/B, attackers spawn on both sides.
- Pearl: A/B, traditional lanes, mid pressure matters.
- Lotus: A/B/C, rotating doors, split site hits.
- Sunset: A/B, layered mid control.
- Abyss: A/B, high risk edges and spacing.
- Corrode: A/B, mid pressure and timing windows.

Common Micro-Errors (Coach Signals)
- Free death: death within 15s with no damage or impact.
- Controller dying first: team loses smokes for the round.
- Duelist baiting: high K/D but low first blood rate.
- Bad economy: force buys when team should save under 4000 credits.
- Unused ultimate: dies with ultimate available in a lost round.

How To Counter Tendencies
- If a team repeats a site, stack early utility and rotate late.
- Against rush teams, hold choke points and delay with utility.
- Against slow teams, take map control early and contest defaults.
- If they rely on a few agents, plan counters for those abilities.
